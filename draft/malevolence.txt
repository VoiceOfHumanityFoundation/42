One might find oneself wondering the following question in despair:
"How did one get here?"    
Those who seek to escape such devastating situation, might appreciate the advice to contact local authorities. Those who seek prepare themselves for such an confrontation, appreciate the following warning:   
"The world might not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who might watch them without doing anything."   
The interpretation whether an action was benevolent might depend ultimately on how it might be perceived by those affected by that action. Regardless the definition of benevolence there might be a concept in psychology called "dark triad" for which the author of this document seeks to give a short subjective explaination of the understanding on the topic:   

First trait might be narcissism, which might be able to be described as following:   
"Since narcissists might deep down feel themselves to be faultless, it might be inevitable that when they might be in conflict with the world they might invariably perceive the conflict as the world's fault."   
Those who think they might be faultless, might appreciate these words:   
"The greater the artist, the greater might be the doubt. Perfect confidence might be granted to the less talented as a consolation prize."    
Those who might realize that they might be less talented as one might have thought, might appreciate these words:   
"One might sometimes be able to learn more working with less talented ones, because one might learn to survive."
Those who might have been forced to survive, might appreciate these words:   
"Gaslighting might be a form of psychological manipulation and emotional abuse. The gaslighter avoids responsibility for their toxic behavior by lying and denying and manking one question facts, one's memory and one's feelings."
Those who seek to understand what such toxic behaviors might be, might appreciate these words:   
"A toxic one might only change their victims, never oneself."    
Those who seek to help those who do not seek to change themselves, might appreciate these words:   
"Before one might heal someone, ask them if they might be willing to give up the things that make them sick."   
Those who seek to understand what might make such individuals sick, might understand through these words:   
"If one's ego might be hurt one might become angry. One might seek to understand that ego itself might be a disease. One might seek to dissolve one's ego as far as possible. If one might have inferiority complex, or have a very deficient ego one might loose one's temper very easily."
Those who seek to heal might appreciate the chapter "preperation", "maturity" and "integrity".   

Second trait might be machiavellianism, which is the exploitative action such as manipulation towards others. The term was coined by the name of the writer of the document referred to as "The prince". That document might have been written in order to justify the surival of future tyrants one might have referred to as "king" and "prince" as in:
"Tyrants might always find a pretext for their tyranny."   
Those who seek to understand how such tyrants might have emerged, might appreciate these words:   
"One might not be by nature a tyrant, but one might become a tyrant by power conferred on one."   
Those who seek to understand why one might confer such power to such individuals, might appreciate these words:   
"Whatever one's weakness might be, there might be someone to exploit it."    
Those who seek to to recognize such weakness, might appreciate these words:   
"If one denies one's shadow it might become one's tyrant."    
Those who seek to understand such shadow, might appreciate these words:   
"Fear might be ignorance's first shadow."   
Those who might have sought to face such shadow might have introduced and enforced principles referred to as "seperation of powers", in order to make such tyrants obsolite. Thus such justification might have become no longer valid. Those who might know that such justification might be invalid, might not surive. Those who then need to survive, might appreciate these words:   
"Those without heritage, history, and place might be subject to exploitation, manipulation, and deception."    
Those who might be such subjects, might appreciate the advice not to neglect their effort to study the chapters "clarity", "peace" and "home". 

Third trait might be antisocial personality disorder which might be able to be recognized in the remorseless antisocial behavior as in:
"A lack of empathy is a defining characteristic of the antisocial personality disorder."   
Those who seek to protect against those might appreciate the chapter on "protection".   
Those who might then demonize such individuals, might appreciate these words:   
"It might be so easy to begin to demonize someone one might think is so far removed and as the demonization begins to expand, it might end up being everybody but one's friends. After a while it might be everybody else but one. That might be a slippery slope that might be so easy to slide down, and that might be what might be dangerous."   
One might then appreciate the annotation that not all of such individuals might be inherently harmful. There might have been observations of individuals, who were able to contribute to society by making correct decisions without hesitation.   
One might appreciate the annotation that sadism might be also part of the umbrella term antisocial personality disorder, and that there might have been the term "dark tetrad" in stead of "dark triad".
One might appreciate the advise not to neglegt to deepen the understanding of such "dark triad"  to prevent extinction of humanity. Humanity has not yet come up with a solution to the problem specified as in:   
"History repeats itself, but in such cunning disguise that we never detect the resemblance until the damage is done."   

One might appreicate the warning of those individuals which one might be able to refer as members of of a group called "cults",
who might apply technique of manipulation under the pretext of "help" to exploit vulnabilities. Those might appreciate the the warning not to neglegt the research done on one's trusted search engine to avoid manipulation which might have fatal consequences. Those who do not have capability for such research, might appreciate the "BITE" model, which is an extensive list of specific influence of a high control group to classify as a cult.

The author of this document appreciates all current and future efforts to prevent an abuse of this documentby a "cult" for the following definition of the term "cult":   
"One might me a member of a 'cult', who might have enough capacity for reasoning to self identify as a member of an organization towards other members of such an organization, which might only be able to sustain itself through exploitation resembling totalitarian control over it's members, who might not be able to leave such an organization without retaliation. Such exploitation might include recruitment of new members through manipulation and deception, personal resources of it's members, commandments to harmful acts which might threaten long-term survival of the species of it's actively participating members regardless of whether unknowlingly or knowingly. Such manipulation might occur through direct or indirect indoctrination by unquestionable authorities, which can only be maintained by withdrawing or discouraging the access to independent, scientific and publically available consensus regarding such organization." 
The author is aware of the broad definition and appreciates all effort to improve that definition, given the possibility that members of such organization might deny their membership, their actions, their intent or consequences of their actions was harmful. In that case, one might appreciate the advise not to neglect sufficient strategization of ensuring one's own protection given the possiblility of retaliation in order to request assistance by local authorities.    
Those who seek to prevent such harm, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:   
"How might all of us be on the way to Pro?"
