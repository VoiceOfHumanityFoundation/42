One might find oneself having an internal conflict as in:   
"A flaw of one might be: the compulsion to be unique, which might be at war with the desire to belong to a single identifiable sameness."    
Those who might seek to understand why one might seek to belong to such identifiable sameness, might appreciate the chapter on "unity". Those who might struggle from such compulsion, might appreciate these words:   
"To be identified with one's mind might to be trapped in time. The compulsion might arise because the past might give one an identity and the future might hold the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both might be illusions. Life might be now."   
Those who might be struggling with such an identification with one's mind, might appreciate these words:   
"The merit of originality might not be novelty; it might be sincerity."   
Those who might seek to understand such sincerity, might appreciate these words:   
"Sincerity might be an openness of heart. One might find it in very few. What one might usually see might be only an artful dissimulation to win the confidence of others."
Those who might then seek to open such heart in a figure of speech, might appreciate these words:
"One might open one's heart knowing that there might be a chance it might be broken one day and in opening one's heart, one might experience a love and joy that one might never have dreamed possible."
Those who might seek to dream in such a way, might appreciate the chapter on "imagination". Those who might seek such novelty might be devastated upon these words:    
"Originality might exist in every individual, because everyone might differ from the others. Everyone might be all primary numbers divisible only by themselves."    
Those who might then seek such sincerity might apprecite these words:    
"Originality might come from just being true to oneself and what one might value about what one might be able to see."    
Those who might not be able to value what they see, might appreciate the following words:    
"Vision might the art of seeing what is invisible to others."    
One might understand, what might be "invisible to others" through these words:    
"Everything might have beauty, but not everyone might see it."    
One might understand one reason, why not everyone might see it through these words:   
"There might certainly no absolute standard of beauty. That might precisely be what might make its pursuit so interesting."   
Those who might be tempted by the idea of absolute standard of beauty, might appreciate these words:
"It might be amazing how complete the delusion might be that beauty might be goodness."
One might understand why such beauty might not be goodness through these words:   
"Danger might hide in beauty and beauty in danger."   
Those who might still seek to pursuit such beauty, might appreciate these words:    
"The standard of beauty might not be definite. One might define it for oneself."   
Those who might struggle to define one's own standards of beauty, might appreciate these words:    
"One's own standards of beauty might be a form of genius â€“ might be higher, indeed, than genius, as it might need no explanation."   
One might understand oen reason, why such beauty might need no explaination through these words:   
"One might not seek to explain one's philosophy. One might seek to embody it."   
Those who might seek to understand such genius, might appreciate the chapter on courage and these words:   
"Talent might hit a target no one else might be able hit; Genius might hit a target no one else might be able to see."  
Those who might seek to hit a target no one else might be able to see, might appreciate these words:   
"One might have stopped explaining oneself when one might have realized others might only understand from their level of perception."    
Those who might seek to elevate their level of perception, might appreciate these words:    
"One might seek first to understand, then to be understood."   
Those who might seek to understand, might appreciate these words:    
"The more original a discovery, the more obvious it might seem afterwards."    
Those who might seek such discovery, might appreciate these words:
"One might be what one might repeatedly do. Excellence might not be an act, but a habit."   
Those whose habit might seem to be hindering from such excellence, might appreciate these words:
"Tradition might be just peer pressure from the dead."
Those who might still be confronted with such peer pressure, might appreciate these words:
"If one might associate oneself with peer pressure or complacency, one might be destined for failure."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:
"How might one be able to find happiness without authentic self-esteem? How might one be able to be authentic when everything one might read, say, or do might be being fed into a judgment machine."   
Those who might be confronted with such a judgement machine, might appreciate these words:
"It might be impossible to design a system so perfect that no one might need to be good."   
Those who might seek to be good, might appreciate the following habits of the author, as an inspiration to improve upon, not as something to be followed without critial thinking as in:    
"Those who might seek to find oneself, might seek to think for oneself."
