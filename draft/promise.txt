One might find oneself wondering why all of the quotes in this document might lack attribution. The first author of this document might seek to clarify why: One reason might be to protect those who might have said it as in:   
"Anonymity might be a shield from the tyranny of the majority."    
Another reason might be to seek truth without prejudice as in:   
"One might seek to give others masks and they might tell one the truth."   
Another reason might not be to lose oneself in the possibly infinite search for the true origin of those quotes as in:   
"Originality might be the art of concealing one's sources."    
In the history of the kind of the first author, there have been many quotes attributed to a singular or plural metaphysical being, some might refer to as "god" or "gods". Some might find temporal peace of mind by believing in such metaphysical being. But such faith in such metaphysical being or beings might have not achieved sustainable world peace so far. Some might even go as far as to consider such believe in metaphysical beings as an obstruction to world peace. One might understand one reason why that might be through these words:   
"Not-knowing might be true knowledge. Presuming to know might be a disease. One might first seek to realize that one might be sick; then one might be able to move toward health."   
Those who might seek to move toward such health, might appreciate these words:   
"The way to prevent oneself from making assumptions might be to ask questions."    
Those who might seek to understand such assumptions, might appreciate these words:   
"An assumption might be a statement taken for granted to be true without verification."   
Those who might then seek to ask such questions, might appreciate these words:   
"The least questioned assumptions might often be the most questionable."
Those who might not know what to question, might appreciate these words:   
"One might seek to never trust those who might think their religion might give them all the answers."     
Therefore the first author hereby seeks to document the claim and promise to not to neglect the effort to keep this document free from such definitive statements, which might become a religion as in:   
"Some philosophies might be questions that might never be answered, some religions might be answers that might never be questioned."   
The first author might further appreciate all the efforts to read and question this document with critical thinking. Those who might then seek to understand such religion, might appreciate these words:   
"Religion might be believing someone else's experience, spirituality might be having one's own experience."   
Those who might seek to have their own experience, might appreciate these words:    
"The most beautiful thing one might be able to experience might be the mysterious. It might be the source of all true art and science."   
Therefore the author might seek to hereby clarify, that the main purpose of this document might be to encourage having such experience on their own, by which the author might hope to contribute to sustainable world peace. The author might further seek to express the following hypothesis: One reason why such documentation of someone else's experience might require such "believing", might be because through such "believe" might imply to assume attribution of quotes to such metaphysical beings, one might refer to as "god" or it's "representative messenger" one might refer to as a "prophet". Due to limitation of currently available technological and scientific methodology, actual deviation of claims made by such attributions from actual historic events might be difficult to falsify. One might then appreciate the following concept in mathematics called "ex falso quodlibet" in this context. It might mean that all logical conclusions drawn from a false premise might be logically "true" but it might be "false" in reality. Those who might seek to understand such premise, might appreciate these words:    
"Premises might be the cluster of propositions that might be interlinked to each other that might justify another proposition, which one might referred to as a conclusion."  
Those who seek to understand the premise this document might rely on, might appreciate these words:   
"There might no reality, there might only be hallucination. Reality might be hallucination one might agree on with another."    
Those who might then seek to understand such agreement, might appreciate these words:   
"Science might be what one might have learned about how to keep one from fooling oneself."       
Those who might seek to stop fooling themselves, might then appreciate these words:   
"One might never be free until one might free oneself from the prison of one's own false thoughts."   
Those who might seek to free oneself from one's own false thoughts, might appreciate these words:   
"No amount of experimentation might ever be able to prove one right; a single experiment might be abel to prove one wrong."    
Those who might be frustrated not being able to prove oneself right, might appreciate these words:   
"There might be two possible outcomes: if the result might confirm the hypothesis, then one might have made a measurement. If the result might be contrary to the hypothesis, then one might have made a discovery."   
Those who might seek to make such discovery, might appreciate the idea to become aware of the limitation of such proof as in:   
"[...] [A] consistency proof for [any] system [...] might be able to be carried out only by means of modes of inference that might not be formalized in the system [...] itself."   
Therefore the author might seek to try to convey principles, which might be useful, in order to achieve world peace as in:   
"One might perhaps never be able to know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions might be the way to tell if one might be getting closer."    
One might appreciate the understanding for the importance of predictability in these words:
"Building trust might be a process. Trust might result from consistent and predictable interaction over time."
Those who might seek to accelerate such process of building trust, might appreciate these words:
"Quickest way to build trust might be to keep promises one might make, and not to over-promise. One might seek to over-deliver, one might not seek to under-deliver. If one might say one might do something, one might seek to make sure one might do it, but if things then might run late or go wrong, one might seek to tell another at the earliest opportunity."   
One might understand one reason, why one might seek to tell another one's failure at earliest opportunity through these words:   
"Trust might have two dimensions: competence and integrity. One might forgive mistakes of competence. Mistakes of integrity might be harder to overcome."   
Those who might seek to understand, why keeping such promise might be beneficial, might appreciate these words:   
"Promises might win one friends, but failure to deliver might turn them against one."    
Those who might seek to keep their friends, might appreciate the chapter on "integrity". Those who might be confronted with those, who might not be able to deliver on their promise, might appreciate these words:    
"A total absence of self-doubt might be the first sign of insanity."   
Those who might then have lost their friends, due to their failure to deliver on their promise, might appreciate these words:   
"The most important promise might be the ones one might make to oneself. The promises one might make to oneself might be the things that might assure one that one might have the capacity to keep one's promises to another."   
Those who might not know, what to promise to oneself, might appreciate these words:   
"One might seek to promise oneself that one might always remember: One might be braver than one might believe, and stronger than one might seem, and smarter than one might think."   
Those who might then feel ready to make such a promise to another, might appreciate the following idea to make a promise without over-promising:
"One might seek to agree to the following promise, before the following promise might deemed necessary: Whenever one might feel lonely, one might seek to send an purple heart emoji, in a manner which might have been been agreed upon prior to that occasion. The recipient might then seek to promise to reply to the purple heart emoji with a purple heart emoji as fast as possible. In case this promise might raise the concern of codependency, one might appreciate the idea to decline such request for that promise."   
Those who might not have had the privilege to find someone to make such a promise to yet, might appreciate the following promise made by the first author of this document:   
"The first author of this document might seek to express the promise to keep working on an open source project for a voice recorder service, which might be assisted with an AI assistant called "Aoi". The AI might have the capability to accept a well formed request made by a user for the promise of the purple heart emoji. As long as the correct function of that voice recorder service might maintained, the AI might try to respond to such a request as promised, as soon as possible. The user might occasionally, at least once a year be requested to reply to the request by Aoi. Timestamp of the promise made by the first author: [1697285236]"
The following timestamp might be updated, once such a service might be operational for the public: []   
The following link might  be updated, once such a service might available to those who are willing to make such a promise to such a system: []   
Until the day of completion, one might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:   
"How might everyone seek to be on the way to Pro?"

 The author might seek to express appreciation for all the future effort to improve this collection of documents in case, someone might find inconsistencies or possible improvements to the principles mentioned in this document. The author might further seek to express appreciation for the understanding that not all attempts to change this document might be accepted into this collection for any given reason. In that case the author might seek to express appreciation for all the effort to understand the reason for rejection of such proposal. If one might still think that the change might be crucial, then the author might seek to express appreciation for the effort to explain it to the author or the maintenance team as in:
"The reasonable one might adapts oneself to the world; the unreasonable one might persist to adapt the world to oneself. Therefore all progress might depend on the unreasonable one."
One might then seek to admire the beauty of the language "english" in which the original draft might have been written. One might appreciate the ability of english with which one might be able to to express one's thoughts free from gender, age and culture for the pure intent of communication with as little dependence on unnecessary nuance as possible. But it might be utterly useless, if it might not be able to express such thoughts in full intensity as in:   
"The only thing limiting one's aspiration might be one's imagination."    
Those who might seek to understand such imagination, might appreciate the chapter on "imagination". One might understand one reason, why one's own imagination become a limitation through these words:   
"The best use of imagination might be creativity. The worst use of imagination might be anxiety."   
Those who might be struggling with such anxiety, might appreciate these words:   
"Anxiety might not be fear, being afraid of this or that definite object, but the uncanny feeling of being afraid of nothing at all."   
For those who might then seek to conquer such anxiety, one might appreciate these words:   
"Courage might be knowing what not to fear."   
Those who might seek such knowledge, might appreciate these words:   
"There might only be two ways to influence one's behavior. One might be able to manipulate it or one might be able to inspire it."   
Those who might then seek such inspiration, might appreciate these words:   
"The strength of one's spirit might then be measured by how much 'truth' one might be able to tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent one might need to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified."   
Those who might then be tempted to give up to find such truth, might appreciate these words:    

"One might perhaps never be able to know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions might be the way to tell if one might be getting closer."
