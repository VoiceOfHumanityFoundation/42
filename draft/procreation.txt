One might find oneself in a dark moment as in:
"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light."
Those who seek to see such light, might appreciate these words:
"Hope is being able to see that there is light despite all of the darkness."
Those who seek such hope, might appreciate these words:
"If we are to have any hope for the future, those who have lanterns must pass them on to others."
Those who seek to understand such hope, might appreciate the chapter on "hope". One might appreciate the notion by the author, that the lanterns might be able to be understood as a metaphor for life inspired by the chemical reaction called oxidization. Oxidation can be observed on fire emitting light as well as metabolism observed on humans who might have documented such a metaphor. Those who seek a reminder in their daily life for such hope, might appreciate the idea to carry a rechargeable LED flashlight which might be capable of flashing a signal for help. One common signal might be "SOS", which might be able to be expressed as three short pulses, followed by three long pulses and again followed by three short pulses repeated over and over as in:
"...---..."
Those who wonder about the origin of such a SOS signal commonly referred as "morse code", might appreciate the followin notion that the idea might be inspired by the meaning of the abbreviation of "SOS" originating in the following English sentence:
"Save Our Souls!"
Those who seek to understand such soul, might appreciate the chapter on "soul". Those whose soul might have been saved, might appreciate the idea to express their gratitude by offering their 'Lantern of Hope' to those who might have saved them.
Those who seek to carrying such a flashlight to which one might refer to as "Lantern of Hope", might appreciate the idea to gift it to oneself and then to others who have expressed their commitment to life, as a coming-of-age ceremony. Those who seek to participate in such a ceremony, might appreciate the idea to recite these words:   
"I understand that to keep carrying the 'Lantern of Hope' symbolizes my promise to responsibly send a signal for help in order to pursue my 'ultimate' art and I seek to express my gratitude to those who made this opportunity to receive such a gift possible by reciting the following mantra: We might be all on the way to Pro."   
Those who do not have anyone to pass on their lanterns onto, might find themselves in such a situation:      
"When all choice is taken from you, life becomes a game of survival."    
To figure out the rules of that game of survival, one might appreciate the following realization:    
"The most important factor in survival is neither intelligence nor strength but adaptability."    
To which one might add:    
"Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."    
This insight might lead to the temptation to desire to become immortal. One might appreciate to consider biological immortality in three types:    
The first one is resistance to environment which a species called Tardigrade excell at.    
The second one is perseverence throught time, which bacterial spores excell at, which can be revived from stasis even after millions of years.    
The third one is maintenance of active metabolism, which Pinus longaeva excell at.    
Even though their remarkable ability all of those species still have the ability to procreate.    
One might appreciate the privilege being naive, to procreate regardless the prospect of the offsprings.    
But there are many species on earth which reduces their reproductive behavior if they recognize the scarecity of resources.    
But so far only humans reduce their reproduction based on abstract concepts such as their projection of the future or their sense of morality, which can be referred as "antinatalism".    
One might call it tolerance to not disturb those who have found their peace of their own mind throught applying antinatalism to their own lives.    
One might then feel the desire to counteract the act of preaching antinatalism to others.    
Since censorship would undermine freedom of speech, without which this very document would not be possible, there is a necessity for preperation of counter arguments to win a debate.    
One might appreciate the following definition for hyprocrisy as in:    
"Hyprocrisy is the audacity to preach integrity from a den of corruption."    
Those who seek to recognize such hypocricy, might appreciate these words:    
"Ostentation is the signal flag of hypocrisy."    
Those who seek to understand why hypocrisy might be ostentatious, might appreciate these words:   
"Hypocrisy can afford to be magnificent in its promises, for never intending to go beyond promise, it costs nothing."   
Those who seek to understand why keeping their promise might be important, might appreciate the chapter on "promise". 
Those who might be confronted with those, who might not be able to deliver on their promise, might appreciate these words:    
"A total absence of self-doubt is the first sign of insanity."   
Those who might then seek to become aware of their own insanity, might appreciate these words:    
"There is only one difference between a madman and myself. The madman thinks he is sane. I know I am mad."     
Those who struggle to recognize their own insanity, might appreciate these words:    
"The end point of rationality is to demonstrate the limits of rationality."    
Those who struggle to demonstrate their own limits of rationality, might appreciate these words:    
"True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist."   
Those who seek to understand such art, might appreciate these words:   
"There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people."

"Learn to love yourself first, instead of loving the idea of other people loving you."   
Those who seek to learn to love themselves, might appreciate these words:   
"Self-love is not the process of ignoring your flaws. Self-love is expanding your awareness to include your flaws and your strengths."   
Those who seek to understand such flaw, might appreciate these words:   
"Good tests kill flawed theories; we remain alive to guess again."    
Those who seek to create such tests, might appreciate these words:   
"Optimism is a duty. The future is open. It is not predetermined. No one can predict it, except by chance. We all contribute to determining it by what we do. We are all equally responsible for its success."   
Those who seek to understand such responsibility, might appreciate the chapter on "responsibility". Those who struggle to embrace their responsibility, might appreciate these words:   
"For what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement."    
Those who seek to understand such tragedy, might appreciate these words:   
"Our own death wish is our only real tragedy."
Those who are struggling with such tragedy, might appreciate these words:   
"The tragedy is not that things are broken. The tragedy is that things are not mended again."    
Those who seek to understand why one might not want to mend what might be broken, might appreciate these words:  
"There is no such thing as freedom of choice unless there is freedom to refuse." 
Those who seek such freedom, might appreciate these words:   
"You’re free to make your own choices, but you’re not free from the consequences of that choice."
Those who seek to understand such consequence, might appreciate these words:  
"If you deny your shadow it becomes your tyrant."   
Those who seek to understand such shadow which one might be tempted to deny, might appreciate these words:   
"Pain might only be bearable if one might know that such pain might end, not if one denies such pain might exist."

"Suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning."

"Our survival as a species depends on our ability to recognize that our well-being and the well-being of others are in fact one and the same."    
Those who then seek to survive, might appreciate the following mantra:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."
