"Denigrating art one might not understand might not hurt the art - it might reveal something about one's willingness to learn."   
Those who might not have such willingness to learn, might appreciate these words:

"Every child might be an artist. The challenge might be how to remain an artist once one might have grown up."   
One might understand one reason, why one might seek to remain such an artist through these words:

"Building trust might be a process. Trust might result from consistent and predictable interaction over time."    
Those who might seek to start such a process of building trust, might appreciate these words:
"Quickest way to build trust might be to keep promises one might make, and not to over-promise. One might seek to over-deliver, one might not seek to under-deliver. If one might say one might do something, one might seek to make sure one might do it, but if things then might run late or go wrong, one might seek to tell another at the earliest opportunity."   
Those who might be tempted to claim an action as a proof for trust without such a promise prior to that action, might appreciate these words:

Those who might seek to criticize such myths, might appreciate these words:   
"Myth might be what one might call religion of others."   
Those who might seek to understand such religion, might appreciate these words:    
"Some philosophies might be questions that might never be answered, some religions might be answers that might never be questioned."   
Those who might might be confronted with those whose answers might never be questioned, might appreciate these words:

"Might one be able to know truth?"

"Love might be the greatest connection to one's own kind when everything else might be falling apart."   
Those who might seek to know, how everything else might be falling apart, might appreciate these words:    
"Weltschmerz, basically, might be the depression one might feel when bamboozlers, fanatics, manipulators, trolls, bigots, demagogues, fear-mongers, liars and prigs might threaten to take over the world, and there might be nothing, one might think, one might be able to do about it."  
One might then be tempted to give up as in: 
"One might not be able to be deeply responsive to the world without being saddened very often."   
Those who might be struggling with such sadness, might appreciate these words:   
"When one might no longer be able to change a situation – one might be challenged to change oneself."

"One might see humans but no humanity."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:    
"'Humanity' might be nothing to be seen, but something to be heard. Humanity might be to listen carefully for the call for help, and then to replying with help. The 'Voice of Humanity' might consist of three messages: First - the call for help, second - listening and replying with help and third - the expression of gratitude after such help."   
Those who might seek to help, might appreciate these words:

Those who might hesitate to treat such passion within one to treat as an miracle, might appreciate these words:   
"Miracles might not be contrary to nature, but only contrary to what one might know about nature."  
Those who might then seek to understand such nature, might appreciate these words:    
"A miracle might often be the willingness to see the common in an uncommon way."

The event "The 'Ultimate' Art" might display a video collage of the "ultimate" art of artists, who might have voluntarily submitted a minimal report of the progress on their art, they might have made since the last event. Those who might struggle to find such art one might worthy of submission, might appreciate the idea to be mindful in one's every day life, during which one might find oneself in a state called "flow" as in:
"Flow might be a state of being when one might be completely focused, and fully immersed in what one might be doing. In flow one's work might seem effortless, creativity might go into overdrive, one might feel inspired, and motivation might spring forth from within."

One might appreciate the notion of the first author that the word "see" might imply not only vision but senses which one might be able to perceive. It might not be a essencial requirement, but the effort to ask the following question at the begining might be be appreciated: "How might we be all on the way to Pro?"   
One might appreciate the clarification, that asking such question at the begging, might imply that the display one's art might be one's approach on how to be on one's way to Pro. The author of this document might seek to express appreciation in advance for the understanding of the collaborators that those submissions which might be violating the community guidelines might not be able to be included in the final stream. If the total amount of runtime of valid submissions might exceed the duration of the event, submissions might be selected randomly using a true entropy random number generator to minimize bias in the selection process.
