1. Those who might seek to survive accidents, might appreciate these words:

2. Those who might seek to survive "black outs" or "power outages", might appreciate to undestand four possible causes. One cause might be, spontanious negative feedback loop of instable systems, which one might be able to mitigate by investing in fortification of existing power grid through battery banks and efforts to achieve and maintain off-grid life style. Another cause might be due to depleation of avaiable energy sources. Those who might seek to mitigate those risks, might appreciate in investing in  renewable or sustainable power sources such as solar, wind, georthermy or nuclear fusion. Another cause might be EMPs destroying transformators. This might be either caused by nuclear bombs or solar flares, for which one might seek to make the electronics EMP proof, which might not possible at the time of the writing of this document. One might appreeciate the idea, not to neglect the effort to research for solutions, such as improving means of prediction through observation of cycles. Another reason might be cyber or physical attacks on the infrastructure, for which one might be able to invest and research in fortification.   
3. Those who might seek to survive climate change and weather extremes, might appreciate the ideas to reduce reckless mass consumer behaviour, more investment in sustainable innovations, more research in safe places to live, fully autarkic hydroponic agricultural systems, which all might converge to working on an submarine mentioned in the chapter on "asylum".   
4.

Another way might be to educate about cyber security, artificial intelligence and technology in order to create of automated defense mechanism, which might not go beserk, which might be difficult to achieve at the time of the writing of this document.   
5. Those who might seek to survive the declining birthrate observed at the time of the writing of this document, might appreciate the idea to educate about factors for infertility, for which one might appreciate the chapter on "health". Another more immediate solution might be to increase financial support and incentive for caregivers (e.g. UBI (universal basic income), and education, therapy and volunterring for caregivers to conter act despair as mentioned in the chapter on "hope". Another more direct way might be to preserve of genetic diversity through donation of cells for procreation for surrogate pregnancy or an artificial womb.   
6. Those who might seek to survive pandemic level diseases might appreciate the idea to educate and to research, in ordre to maintain and increase the means to produce resources for medical care and financial support to distribute such products to those in need.   
7. Those who might seek to survive impact of asteroid on their habitat, might appreciate the idea to maintain the means for longterm observation of celestial bodies or innovation in space travel to counter act them or to escape it, without getting damaged by high level of space radiation and effects of low gravity level.   
8.
