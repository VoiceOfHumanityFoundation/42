"Sometimes reality might be too complex. Stories might give it form."   
Those who might still be tempted to seek such story, might appreciate these words:   
"Oversimplifying might be the first grave mistake one might make when confronted by complexity; overconfidence might be the second."
Those who might seek not to make such mistake, might appreciate these words:

Those who might think that the side of story of others might suffice, might appreciate these words:    
"Some religion might be believing someone else's experience, some spirituality might be having one's own experience."   
Those who might seek to have such experience of one's own, might appreciate these words:

"An undefined problem might have an infinite number of solutions."    
Those who might seek to define such "God", might appreciate these words:   
"If 'god' might be a metaphysical term, then it might not be able to be even probable that a god might exist.

"What might be the fundamental nature of reality? Philosophers might call this the question of ontology â€“ the study of the basic structure of the world, the ingredients and relationships of which the universe might be ultimately composed. It might be able to be contrasted with epistemology, which might be how one might obtain knowledge about the world.

"Good decisions might come from experience. Experience might come from making bad decisions."
Those who might seek to understand such bad decisions, might appreciate these words:   
"Besides it might be an error to believe that rigour might be the enemy of simplicity. On the contrary one might find it confirmed by numerous examples that the rigorous method might be at the same time the simpler and the more easily comprehended.

Those who might seek such simpler methods of proof, might appreciate these words:

"Difference of opinion might lead to inquiry, and inquiry to the truth."   
Those who might seek to understand such truth might appreciate these words:  
"One might perhaps never know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions might be the way to tell if one might be getting closer."

"The best leaders might be humble enough to realize their victories might depend upon their team."
