"Eudaimonia" might be a concept describing a state of human being who is in a optimal state of thriving. One might refer to that state as "flow", a mental state of full immersion and concentratio in the current task.
Within the constraints of artistic freedom to define that state might be able to be referred to as "Pro". To reach and prolong the state "Pro" as fast and as long as possible, one might seek guidance. One might then appreciate the following enumeration of requirements for an generic overall design for the server:   
1. E2E encryption   
2. Access to P2P network   
3. Direct communicaiton to a gateway   
4. Self hosted   
5. zero knowledge hosting   
6. GPU accelerated STT engine (faster-whisper probably)   
7. GPU acclerated embedding model and vector database (milvus)   
8. GPU acclerated multiagent llms   
9. GPU acclerated knowledge database (neo4j with milvus probably)   
10. Deterministic generation of knowledge base from the philosophical essays   
11. GPU accelerated TTS engine (piper probably)   
12. Using "prompt.txt" as prefix for prompt.   
13. Deployment using nixos, docker, radicle.xyz and ipfs (Probably)   
14. Implementing various gateways for client applications   
    
One might then be able to appreciate the following enumeration of requirements for a mobile terminal device system capable of running a client application which might be able to offer such guidance:   
1.At least 4GB DDR4 RAM for offline speech recognition and local LLM.   
2. At least the computing power of H618 processor.   
3. Wireless throat microphone to respect privacy of others.   
4. Rechargable battery operated for artistic freedom.   
5. Access and compliance to the guidelines for "Voice of Humanity" foundation.   
6. Custom wake word "Aoi" to activate access to the server. 
7. Ability for conversational guidance asking the following question:   
"How might everyone be on the way to Pro?"
