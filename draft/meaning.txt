One might find oneself suffering as in: 
"There might be but one truly serious philosophical problem and that might be suicide."   
Those who might be considering such suicide, might be adviced to consult mental health care professionals. Those who might still be contemplating such question, might appreciate these words:   
"The literal meaning of life might be whatever one might be doing that might prevent one from killing oneself."   
Those who might seek such literal meaning of life, might appreciate these words:   
"Life itself might have not meaning. Life might be an opportunity to create a meaning."
Those who might seek to create such meaning, might appreciate these words:   
"Life might have meaning only if one might do what might meaningful to one."    
Those who might not be able to find something meaningful to do, might appreciate these words:   
"If there might be meaning in life at all, then there might have to be meaning in suffering."   
Those who might seek such meaning in one's suffering, might appreciate these words:   
"Pain might be inevitable. Suffering might be optional."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be, through these words:   
"Pain might only be bearable if one might know that such pain might end, not if one denies such pain might exist."  
Those who seek to know, when such pain might end, might appreciate these words:    
"Suffering might cease to be suffering at the moment it might find a meaning."   
Those who might seek to find such meaning, might appreciate these words:

Those who might have not found such meaning yet, might appreciate these words:   
"The meaning of one's life might be to help others find meaning in theirs."   
Those who might seek to help find others meaning in their lives, might appreciate the following summerization of the  "three principles of logotherapy", which might be an effective method to help those who might not be able to find meaning in their own lives on their own. Those who might seek such therapy, might appreciate the explicit advice of the author of this current document to seek professional help, since in most countries medical advices might only be permitted to give by professional health care workforces.   
The first principle: "Life might have meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones."    
The second principle: "One's main motivation for living might be one's will to find meaning in life."   
The third principle: "One might have freedom to find meaning in what one might do, and what one might experience, or at least in the stance one might take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering."  
Those who might seek to understand such freedom, might appreciate these words:   
"Everything might be taken from one but one thing: the last of one's freedoms â€“  to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."  
Those who might seek such freedom, might appreciate these words:   
"If liberty might have any meaning it might mean freedom to improve."   
Those who might have not found such meaning yet, might appreciate these words:   
"When one might not be able to find a deep sense of meaning, one might distract oneself with pleasure."
Those who might seek to understand, why one might distract oneself with such a pleace, might appreciate these words:   
"True debauchery might be liberating because it might create no obligations."   
Those who might be tempted to liberate oneself from such obligation, might appreciate these words:   
"Life might ask of every individual a contribution, and it might be up to that individual to discover what it might be."   
Those who might be tempted to refuse to discover such contribution, might appreciate these words:   
"If one might not sacrifice for what one might want, what one might want might become the sacrifice."   
One might appreciate the notion of the author that there might have been attempts to actively sacrifice all of one's desires for the peace of one's own mind as in:   
"World peace might never be stable until enough achieve inner peace to stabilize it."   
One might appreciate the notion of the author of this document that at the time of writing such attempts might have not been able to reach critical mass to document a consensus on the successful maintainance of long-term sustainable world peace. One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:    
"Dissociation might appear to be the internal mechanism by which terrorized ones might be silenced."   
Those who might be tempted to silence one's own mind, might appreciate these words:   
"When listening for danger, one might have to never mistake silence for safety."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:   
"The absence of evidence might not be the evidence of absence."   
Those who might seek such absense of danger, might appreciate these words:   
"Peace might not be absence of conflict, it might be the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means."   
Those who might then seek such peace, might appreciate these words:   
"The world might not only be destroyed by those who might do evil, but by those who might watch them without doing anything."   
Those who might seek to prevent such destruction, might appreciate these words:   
"Enlightenment might be one's emergence from one's self-incurred immaturity."   
Those who might seek emerge from such self-incurred immaturity, might appreciate these words:   
"One might have to accept what one might not be able to change, and change what one might not be able to accept."   
Those who might seek to change one might not be able to accecpt, might appreciate these words:   
"Until one's mission might be an obsession, nothing might change in one's life."
Those who have yet to find their mission might appreciate the following realization:
"One's mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style."
Those who seek to thrive might appreciate the chapters "hope", "peace", "good" and "responsiblity". Those who struggle to thrive might appreciate these words:
"The magic one might be looking for might be in the work one might have been avoiding."   
Those who might seek to know what one mighthave been avoiding, might appreciate these words:   
"The only way to deal with an unfree world might be to become so absolutely free that one's very existence might be an act of rebellion."  
Those who might seek such freedom, might appreciate these words:   
"One might refuse to accept the view that one's own kind might be so tragically bound to war that peace and kinhood might never be able to become a reality."   
Those who might seek such peace and kinhood, might appreciate these words:   
"It might be easy to be a naive idealist. It might be easy to be a cynical realist. It might be quite another thing to have no illusions and still hold the inner flame."    
Those who might struggle to hold their "inner flame", which might be able to be understood as a metaphor, might find a way to reignite it through these words:
"In everyone's life, at some time, one's inner fire might go out. It might be then burst into flame by an encounter with another one."
Those who might seek to encounter such another one, might appreciate these words:    
"Next to doing a good job oneself, the greatest joy might be having someone else do a first class job under one's direction."   
Eventhough it might encourage some to become a tyrant,  one might also realize something good - the essence of joy. Which might be that one might feel joy through action, because during action one might be able to reach the state of "flow", in which one might be able to forget ones own suffering without self destructive hedonism. One might then realize that one might be able to feel happiness and joy at the same time, while adressing ones own needs consciously. Those who might seek to address one's need consciously, might appreciate the idea that the highest need in the "hierarchy of needs" mentioned in the chapter on "needs" might be called "self transcendence". One might then understand that the reference of the mentioned quote "someone else do a first class job under one's direction" might be able to be understood as "self transcendence", which might be the very reason why the author of that quote might have called it "the greatest joy", because it might be indeed adressing one's own need of "self transcendence". Those who might seek such self transcendence, might appreciate the warning to offer only the capacity which might be abundant as in:
"Kindness without wisdom might wound."    
Those who might then seek to reach such state of flow through action, might appreciate the idea to find and work on a skill, as in:
"One might seek to do one thing and one might seek to do it well."   
Those who might seek to reach such level of skill, migt appreciate the notion of the author of this document that all the other levels of the hierarchy of needs might have to be met first, otherwise one might find oneself being overwhelmed, which one might refer to as "Weltschmerz" as in:   
"Weltschmerz, basically, might be the depression one might feel when bamboozlers, fanatics, manipulators, trolls, bigots, demagogues, fear-mongers, liars and prigs might threaten to take over the world, and there might be nothing, one might think, one might be able to do about it."  
Those who might seek to reduce such suffering, might appreciate these words:   
"One who might have a why to live for might be able to bear almost any how."   
Those who might seek such reason, might appreciate these words:   
"True art might be characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist."   
Those who might seek to understand such irresistible urge, might appreciate these words:   
"There might be nothing more truly artistic than to love."    
Those who might seek to love, might appreciate these words:   
"Love is the wish to give, not to receive, something."   
Those who might seek to understand what one might seek to give, might appreciate these words:   
"The best way to develop responsibility in others might be to give them responsibility."   
Those who might seek to give others such responsibility, might appreciate these words:   
"One might have the responsibility not to allow the voice of humanity within one to be silenced."   
Those who might seek to understand such "voice of humanity", might appreciate the chapter on "humanity" and the idea to ask the following question:   
"How might we all be on the way to Pro?"
