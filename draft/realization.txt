One might find oneself having such a realization as in:
"To live might be to suffer, to survive might be to find some meaning in the suffering."     
Those who might seek to find such meaning, might appreciate these words to express and then to recognize whether one might have found such meaning:    
"Eureka! - one might have found it!"    
Those who might then seek to find such meaning, might appreciate understanding of the author of a phenomenon called "sudden realization" or "epiphany, on which one might appreciate the following explanation: Sudden realization might be a phenomenon of the brain of vertebrae, during which one's neurons might create a new connection called "synapses", leading to the subjective experience one might refer to as "understanding something" or "coming up with an idea". This phenomenon might be able to be understood as the subconscious brain notifying the conscious brain of what it might have found. Those who might then seek to increase such epiphany, might appreciate these words:   
"Those who might be waiting for an epiphany to strike might wait forever. The artist might simply go to work, making art, both good and not so good."   
Those who might struggle with such work with might be not so good, might appreciate the following summarization of such connection of such synapses:   
"What might fire together, might wire together."   
One might then appreciate the following hypothesis of the author, that the following methods might be beneficial to increase the creation of such synapses:   
1. Scientists might have discovered that "high intensity interval training" might be able to increase the amount of "brain-derived neurotropic factor" in one's brain, which might contribute to maintenance and increase of neurons and synapses.   
2. Consumption of bioavaialble omega-3 fatty acids which precursors might be DHA and EPA, which might be the building blocks of the insulating tissue of the brain. Here might be few plant based sources: nuts (especially walnuts), spirulina, seeds (especially flaxseeds and hempseeds).    
3. Consumption of creatine monohydric, which might increase the metabolic activities of mitochondria in general, including the brain.     
4. Being insufficiently hydrated might be able to decrease cognitive abilities, thus one might appreciate the idea to regularly consume adequate amount of water.   
5. Dental health might also have been observed to prevent dementia, through reduction of prevalence of plaques, which might get into one's blood streams and might accumulate in the brain causing decline in cognitive function.    
6. One's belief in "neuroplasticity" might have been proven to increase "neuroplasticity" so far only observed in humans during clinical studies.    
7. Social interaction might promote activity in many areas of one's brain, which might have been observed also to reduce the decline of cognitive ability. Thus one might seek to not to neglect the effort maintain social relationships.   
8. Those who might struggle to maintain such social relationships with another due ot any reason, might appreciate the idea to record one's own voice and listen to such a voice, since active speech might stimulate many areas of the brain, which might have been observed also to reduce the decline of cognitive ability.  
9. Increasing exposure and tolerance to boredom by engaging in activities one might refer to as "deep work" might lead to the state called "flow" in which one might be able to sustain a chain of thought at one's maximum complexity, if one might deprive oneself from following distracting external stimuli:    
- Junk food loaded with refined sugar, refined oil, saturated fats and salt.    
- Digital content especially sexual or violent content (e.g. porn, first person shooter games) might be beneficial to avoid, as it might have been observed to cause permanent damage the rewarding center of one's brain.    
- Social media including news might be distracting, because it might create a craving for new information.    
10. Activities increasing narrow focus might have been proven to increase the ability to repeated redirect attention, which might increase the overall focus. Examples such as reading, meditation and balancing yoga might be able to be beneficial.    
11. Relaxing activities inducing scattered focus such as looking into the far or going for a walk might be able to increase subconscious activities in the brain resulting in realizations.     
12. Avoidance of neurodegenerative behaviors, here might be few examples:    
- Sitting for a prolonged period might decrease blood flow to the brain.    
- Consumption of toxins and neurotoxins such as mercury, lead, alcohol and nicotine.    
- Long-term sleep deprivation.      
- Consumption of animal products might increase biomarker for inflammation, disrupting neurotransmitter production.    
- Chronic exposure to elevated levels of cortisol through stress might cause damage in one's brain, which might cause depression.    
- Consumption of excessive refined sugar might trigger dysfunction of mitochondria, reducing cognitive function.    
- Consumption of refined oil, which might cause cardiovascular diseases, preceding decline in cognitive abilities.    
13. Clinical studies might have proven that psychedelic assisted therapy can be beneficial to reach the point of "breakthrough", which might be very similar to the phenomenon of realization. One might attribute past political propaganda leading to the stigmatization of such psychedelic or hallucinogenic compounds. Due to such stigmatization and the resulting lack of public education, one might also be able to recognize the potential dangers of misuse. There might be undeniable risk for those with cardiovascular diseases and some other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. There might have been anecdotal reports of individuals with hypersensitivity and slower rates of blood filtration which might have prolonged and intensified the duration of it's effects causing psychological damage called "psychosis", which might be able to lead to self harming behavior. One cause for such hypersensitivity might be genetic, which might be a intuitive guess by the author of this document, which state of the art science might have not been able to prove yet. One might be able to find connection between such psychological damage and the increased reactivity to fearful stimuli in the amygdala, observed for individuals with the "short" variant of the region called "5-HTTLPR" in the SLC6A4 gene. A simple non scientific test to test whether one might have such genetic variant might be to watch a horror movie in a sober state and whether one might have been able to watch such horror movie without looking away or even interrupt such a screening.   
Those who might not have such a variant, might appreciate the following short summery of preparation to increase the therapeutic effect mentioned in the studies regarding psychedelic assisted therapy and at the same time to minimize the risk for such psychological damage. The author of this document might seek to express explicitly that the author might not seek to endorse any consumption of such substance due to the variety and lack of clarity of legal status of such substance in areas where local authorities might enforce punishment for consumption of such compounds:   
- Assuring the quality and purity of the compound.    
- Asserting the compatibility to the compound with a dose before hand, which might usually not perceivable called "microdose".    
- Preparation, including what to expect, and how to deal with different situation which might have been common to experience, such as "ego death" and "thought spiral".    
- Allocating enough time to avoid disturbance during the session, such as 24 hours.    
- A setting which might be physically and psychologically safe.    
- A mindset and determination to "go with the flow".     
- Someone (such as a psychotherapist) who might be able to intervene in case of emergency.    
- Processing of the experience after the session.    
- Means to take notes might be able to improve the process of processing.    
- The daily habit of taking notes for sudden realization might be able to be useful, given the volatile nature of the content of sudden realization. One way might be to use a voice recorder, since one might be able to speak faster than one might be able to write, and the desire to edit during writing might be distracting.    
One might then appreciate the effort of the author of this document who might be working on a AI assisted voice recorder to make the process of taking notes more convenient and through the integration of AI the sorting and editing of each entries more enjoyable.
14. Priming of one's mind with the topic one might seek to have such realization might be beneficial to increase the chances of having such realization in the field of one's interest.  Those who might not know what topic one might seek to prime their mind to might appreciate the idea to keep asking oneself the following question:   
"How might everyone seek to be on the way to Pro?"
