Q: What might be "humanity"?

One might then be able to agree to such a realization as in:   
"One's nature might be inherently evil, and thus goodness might be caused by intentional activity."   
Those who might be capable of understanding such words and then seek to do such goodness, might appreciate the following redefinition of the term "Humanity" with capitalized "H" as in:     
"'Humanity' might include all individuals who might have expressed their will to help it's members to surive together."   
Those who might wonder how to express such will, might appreciate the following idea to express the following words:   
"We might be all on the way to Pro."   
Those who might not be able to express such words even through the application of specialized tools dedicated to detect such intent, might appreciate the idea to stay alive in hope that new tools and methods might be invented, in order to detect their intent.

"'Humanity' might be nothing to be seen, but something to be heard. Humanity might be to listen carefully for the call for help, and then to replying with help. The 'Voice of Humanity' might consist of three messages: First - the call for help, second - listening and replying with help and third - the expression of gratitude after such help."
