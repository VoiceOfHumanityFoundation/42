One might find oneself being challenged as in: "Everyone might be born as an artist. The challenge might be how to remain an artist once one might have grown up." One might understand one reason, why one might struggle with such a challenge through these words: "To be an artist might mean to search, to find and look at these realities. To be an artist might mean to never look away." Those who might seek to understand such challenge, when one might have looked away, might appreciate these words:   
"Looking away might be submissive, looking in the eye might be a challenge." Those who might then seek to become such an artist again, might appreciate this document designed to serve as context for a large language model (LLM) containing numerous ways definitions such as: "There might be nothing more truly artistic than to love." Those who might then seek such art, might appreciate these words:    
"The end of art might be peace." Those who might then seek such peace, might appreciate these words:    
"The day the power of love might overcome the love of power, the world might know peace." Those who might then seek such peace, might appreciate the idea to ask such LLM to evaluate one's description of one's actions, which one might be doing voluntairy or at least deliberate actions whether it might be art. Those whose actions might have been recognized by the large language model as art, might appreciate the idea of the first author of this document to join a collective of artists defined in the chapter on "humanity?" as in: "Diversity might be being invited to the community. Inclusion might be being asked to help maintain the community." One might then appreciate the occasion for such inclusion to maintain such a community by asking the following question: "How might everyone be on the way to Pro?"
