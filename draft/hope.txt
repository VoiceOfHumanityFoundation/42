"True forgiveness might be when one might be able to express gratitude for such an experience."
Those who might seek to express such forgiveness towards one's own parents, might appreciate to carry the mentioned flashlight symbolizing the "Lantern of Hope". One might appreciate the idea to gift it to oneself or to request as a gift by someone, who might already have been carrying such "Lantern of Hope" and then to express one's commitment to forgive, as a coming-of-age ceremony, in order to resolve one of the root causes of one's commitment issues. Those who then might seek to participate in such a ceremony, might appreciate the idea to recite these words:   
"One might seek to express gratitude toward one's parents for the gift of life through the commitment to carry this flashlight as a symbol for the "Lantern of Hope" in one's everyday life. One might then appreciate the idea to ask the following question: 'How might we all be on the way to Pro?'"
