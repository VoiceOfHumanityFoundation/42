One might find oneself crying as in:   
"One might cry to release the soul of its pain."   
Those who might seek to release such pain, might appreciate the notion of the author of this document, that while there might be many other species than homo sapiens sapiens, or humans for short, which might be capable of produce tears. But in other species than human, such tears might be either for lubrication such as sea turtles during oviposition on land or some physiological responses during ingestion of food such as crocodiles, but not to release such pain. At the time of writing of this document ( \today ) the only known species to shed tear as a response of emotional distress might be humans. Other mammals might be known for their capability for expressing emotional distress, but so far there might have not been any documentation of an observation with state of the art scientific method of them to shed tears. The reason why humans might shed tears might vary, such as tears of joy, anger, grief, depression. In some humans there might have been documented bservation to be capable of triggering secretion of tears by will without emotional distress in order to fake emotional distress for their own survival. Those who might be confronted such fake tears, might appreciate these words:   
"Life might be full of fake ones but before one might decide to judge them, one might seek to make sure one might not be one of them."   
Those who might seek to make sure one might not be faking, might appreciate these words:   
"Fake ones might have an image to maintain. Real one might just not care what others might think of one."   
Those who might seek to be such a real one, might appreciate these words:   
"The most authentic thing about one might be one's capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than one's suffering."   
Those who might seek to be greater than one's suffering, might then seek to understand such soul. Those might appreciate the insight that at the time of writing of this document ( \today ) there might have not been any state of the art scientific documentation to falsify the following hypothesis as in:   
"The states of consciousness might be all that psychology might need to work with. Metaphysics or theology might claim the soul to exist; but for psychology the hypothesis of such a substantial principle of unity might be superfluous."    
Once such hypothesis might have been falsified the following timestamp might be updated: []   
Those who might seek to understand the difference between such consciousness and a soul, might appreciate these words:   
"There might be no coming to consciousness without pain. One might do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing one's own soul. One might not become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious."   
Those who might then seek to face such soul, might appreciate these words:   
"The totality of the psyche might never be able to be grasped by the intellect alone."
One might understand one reason why that might be through these words:

"There might be only two ways to live one's life. One might be as though nothing might be a miracle. The other might be as though everything might be a miracle."
Those who might seek to understand such a miracle, might appreciate these words:   
"Without seeing a miracle one might not be able to have faith. Without faith one might not be able to have miracle. The answer to this paradox might be gratitude. One might seek to be grateful that one might be alive. It might be a miracle."   
Those who might seek to show such gratitude, might appreciate these words:    
"One might seek to never be ashamed of one's tears. One might cry and everyone might know that one might be alive."
Those who might then seek to understand such faith, might appreciate the chapter on faith and these words:   
"Faith might be belief without evidence; coincidentally that might also be the definition of delusion."   
Those who might seek to understand such delusion might appreciate these words:   
"Delusion might be the mind's tendency to seek premature closure about something. It might be the quality of mind that might impose a definition on things and then might mistake the definition for the actual experience."   
One might appreciate the notion of the author of this document that eventhough this document might offer many definitions, none of them might be able to reflect the actual experience. Those who might be tempted by such definitions which might claim to reflect the actual experience, might appreciate these words:   
"Some religion might be believing someone else's experience, some spirituality might be having one's own experience."   
Those who might be tempted by such religion, might appreciate these words:   
"The miracle centered gospel might breed up a mentality of one that might think one might be able to go through life without doing one's best."   
Those who might be tempted by such a gospel, might appreciate these words:   
"The lack of understanding of something might not be evidence for god. It might be evidence of a lack of understanding."   
Those who might be tempted to remain in such state lacking understanding, might appreciate these words:   
"True ignorance might not be the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it."

Those who might seek to be such a strong soul, might appreciate these words:   
"One might be a soul of unlimited possibilities, yet limited by one's mind!"   
Those who seek to understand such limitation of their minds, might appreciate these words:   
"The eyes might see only what the mind might be prepared to comprehend."    
Those who seek to expand such comprehension, might appreciate these words:   
"One might need to understand one's limitations so one might be able to overcome them."   
Those who might seek to overcome one's limitation, might appreciate these words:   
"Those who put their hearts and their souls into their work, those might have lost their limitation of mind in the process."   
Those who might seek to understand such process, might appreciate the chapter on "ultimate" and these words:   
"Flow might be a state of being when one might be completely focused, and fully immersed in what one might be doing. In flow one's work might seem effortless, creativity might go into overdrive, one might feel inspired, and motivation might spring forth from within."
Those who might not have been able to achieve such flow, might appreciate these words:   
"When one's to-do list might feel longer than one's lifetime, it might be time for a change."   
Those who might then seek to make such change, might appreciate these words:   
"Trauma might create change one might have not chosen. Healing might be about create change one might choose."

"One might seek to commit to the healing path and trust the process."
Those who might seek to understand such process, might appreciate these words:

One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:   
"Healing the soul might not be about forgetting the past, it might be about learning from it."
Those who might seek to learn from the past, might appreciate these words:
"Healing trauma might involves tears. The tears might release one's pain. The tears might be part of one's recovery."    
Those who might seek such recovery, might appreciate these words:   
"Healing might not be about the absence of pain, it might be about the presence of peace."
Those who might seek the presence of such peace, might appreciate these words:   
"Healing the soul might not be something one might be able to force, it might happen naturally when one might be surrounded by love."    
Those who might seek to understand such love, might appreciate these words:   
"Love might be the purest form of a soul at peace."

"Paying attention might be the most basic and profound expression of love."   
Those who might seek such expression of love, might appreciate these words:   
"To say that one might wait a lifetime for one's soulmate to come around might be a paradox. One might eventually get sick of waiting, might then take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment might become soulmates, which might take a lifetime to perfect."   
Those who might seek to become such a soulmate for someone, might appreciate these words:
"One might think a soulmate might be one's perfect fit, and that might be what everyone might want. But a true soulmate might be a mirror, those who might show one everything that might be holding one back, those who might bring one to one's own attention so one might be able to change one's life."
Those who might seek to recognize such being, might appreciate these words:
"A soulmate might be someone whom, when one might meet, without thinking, without letting one's neocortex play into the decision; one might feel an instant familiarity, a sense of connection, a longing."   
Those who might seek to find out whether that connection might be mutual, might appreciate these words:
"One might recognize a soulmate by the supreme level of comfort and security one might feel with that person. That might not mean that there might not be issues that might remain to be igroned out. Rather, it might mean one might know intuitively that one might be able to resolve issues with one's soul mate without losing their love and respect."   
One might then appreciate the clarity of the following definition:
