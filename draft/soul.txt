One might find oneself crying as in:   
"One might cry to release the soul of its pain."   
Those who might seek to release such pain, might appreciate the notion of the author of this document, that while there might be many other species than homo sapiens sapiens, or humans for short, which might be capable of produce tears. But in other species than human, such tears might be either for lubrication such as sea turtles during oviposition on land or some physiological responses during ingestion of food such as crocodiles, but not to release such pain. At the time of writing of this document ( \today ) the only known species to shed tear as a response of emotional distress might be humans. Other mammals might be known for their capability for expressing emotional distress, but so far there might have not been any documentation of an observation with state of the art scientific method of them to shed tears. The reason why humans might shed tears might vary, such as tears of joy, anger, grief, depression. In some humans there might have been documented observation to be capable of triggering secretion of tears by will without emotional distress in order to fake emotional distress for their own survival. Those who might be confronted such fake tears, might appreciate these words:   
"Life might be full of fake ones but before one might decide to judge them, one might seek to make sure one might not be one of them."   
Those who might seek to make sure one might not be faking, might appreciate these words:   
"Fake ones might have an image to maintain. Real one might just not care what others might think of one."   
Those who might seek to be such a real one, might appreciate these words:   
"The most authentic thing about one might be one's capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love and to be greater than one's suffering."   
Those who might seek to understand such authenticity, might appreciate these words:   
"Believing that one might be enough might be what might give one the courage to be authentic."   
Those who might then seek to believe that one might be enough, might appreciate these words:   
"To define might be to limit."   
Those who might then seek to define that one might be enough, might appreciate these words:   
"Love might be enough. Love might conquer all. Love might really always protect, trust, hope and persevere."   
Those who might then seek such love, might appreciate these words:    
"Souls might love. That might be what souls might do, which egos might not."
Those who might then seek to understand such ego, might appreciate the chapter on "preparation" and these words:   
"The ego's job might be to unalive everything but itself."   
Those who might seek to understand such ego, might appreciate the notion of the author that the Amygdala & Periaqueductal Gray (PAG) might be commonly attributed for such defensive survival mechanisms to which one might further seek to refer as "ego". 
Those who might then seek to understand such "soul", which might be able to love, might appreciate the following notion of the author that the phenomenon of "love" might be commonly attributed to the "mesolimbic reward system" centered on the "ventral striatum" commonly found in vertebrates. One might then appreciate the idea to redefine and address such "mesolimbic reward system" centered on the "ventral striatum" as "soul".The author might appreciate further efforts to find a better such non-metaphysical definition of such soul as in:    
"The totality of the psyche might never be able to be grasped by the intellect alone."
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:   
"As far as one might be able to discern, the sole purpose of one's existence might be to kindle a light of meaning in the darkness of mere being."

"Art might remove the monotony of everyday life from the soul."   
Those who might seek such art, might appreciate these words:   
"Science might be no more than an investigation of a miracle one might never be able to explain, and art might be an interpretation of that miracle."
Those who might seek such a miracle to interpret, might appreciate these words:    
"There might be only two ways to live one's life. One might be as though nothing might be a miracle. The other might be as though everything might be a miracle."
Those who might seek to understand such a miracle, might appreciate these words:   
"Without seeing a miracle one might not be able to have faith. Without faith one might not be able to have miracle. The answer to this paradox might be gratitude. One might seek to be grateful that one might be alive. It might be a miracle."   
Those who might seek to show such gratitude, might appreciate these words:    
"One might seek to never be ashamed of one's tears. One might cry and everyone might know that one might be alive."
Those who might then seek to understand such faith, might appreciate the chapter on faith and these words:   
"Faith might be belief without evidence; coincidentally that might also be the definition of delusion."   
Those who might seek to understand such delusion might appreciate these words:   
"Delusion might be the mind's tendency to seek premature closure about something. It might be the quality of mind that might impose a definition on things and then might mistake the definition for the actual experience."   
One might appreciate the notion of the author of this document that even though this document might offer many definitions, none of them might be able to reflect the actual experience. Those who might be tempted by such definitions which might claim to reflect the actual experience, might appreciate these words:

Those who might be tempted to remain in such state lacking understanding, might appreciate these words:   
"True ignorance might not be the absence of knowledge, but the refusal to acquire it."   
Those who might not know, what knowledge one might have been refusing, might appreciate these words:   
"One might not be able to fix something until one might admit that it might be broken."   
Those who might seek to admit that one might be broken, might appreciate these words:   
"A sign of growth might be being okay with not being okay."   
Those who might seek such growth might appreciate these words:   
"The growth and development of the soul might be more important than power and glory."   
Those who might seek grow their own soul, might appreciate these words:   
"The challenges one might face in life might be lessons that might serve one's soul's growth."   
Those who might seek to understand such challenges, might appreciate these words:   
"Permanence, perseverance, and persistence in spite of all obstacles, discouragements, and impossibilities might distinguish the strong soul from the weak."
Those who might seek to be such a strong soul, might appreciate these words:   
"One might be a soul of unlimited possibilities, yet limited by one's mind!"

"Flow might be a state of being when one might be completely focused, and fully immersed in what one might be doing. In flow one's work might seem effortless, creativity might go into overdrive, one might feel inspired, and motivation might spring forth from within."
Those who might not have been able to achieve such flow, might appreciate these words:   
"When one's to-do list might feel longer than one's lifetime, it might be time for a change."   
Those who might then seek to make such change, might appreciate these words:   
"Trauma might create change one might have not chosen. Healing might be about create change one might choose."   
Those who might seek to make such choice to change, might appreciate these words:  
"Healing might be a choice, and the first step might be to choose to heal."   
Those who might seek to understand what the next step might be to heal, might appreciate these words:   
"One might seek to commit to the healing path and trust the process."
Those who might seek to understand such process, might appreciate these words:   
"Healing the soul might require a journey through the wounds of the past."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:   
"Healing the soul might not be about forgetting the past, it might be about learning from it."

"The first duty of love might be to listen."   
Those who might seek to listen, might appreciate these words:   
"The purest form of listening might be to listen without memory or desire."   
Those who might seek to listen in such a way, might appreciate these words:   
"The difference between hearing and listening might be paying attention."   
Those who might seek to understand what paying attention might mean, might appreciate these words:   
"Paying attention might be the most basic and profound expression of love."   
Those who might seek such expression of love, might appreciate these words:   
"To say that one might wait a lifetime for one's soulmate to come around might be a paradox. One might eventually get sick of waiting, might then take a chance on someone, and by the art of commitment might become soulmates, which might take a lifetime to perfect."   
Those who might seek to become such a soulmate for someone, might appreciate these words:
"One might think a soulmate might be one's perfect fit, and that might be what everyone might want. But a true soulmate might be a mirror, those who might show one everything that might be holding one back, those who might bring one to one's own attention so one might be able to change one's life."
Those who might seek to recognize such being, might appreciate these words:
"A soulmate might be someone whom, when one might meet, without thinking, without letting one's neocortex play into the decision; one might feel an instant familiarity, a sense of connection, a longing."   
Those who might seek to find out whether that connection might be mutual, might appreciate these words:
"One might recognize a soulmate by the supreme level of comfort and security one might feel with that one. That might not mean that there might not be issues that might remain to be resolved. Rather, it might mean one might know intuitively that one might be able to resolve issues with one's soul mate without losing their love and respect."   
One might then appreciate the clarity of the following definition:
"A soul mate might be someone whose way of viewing life might not be necessarily the same as one's own but complements one's own. There might not be a compromise, there might be a complement."   
Those who might seek encounter someone, who might complement oneself, might appreciate these words:
"One might meet one's soulmate when one might be on one's soul path."    
One might find such a path by asking the following question:
