One might find oneself being prosecuted as in:   
"Truth might be the first casualty of tyranny."   
Those who might seek to recognize such tyranny, might appreciate these words:   
"The very definition of tyranny might be when all power might be gathered under one place."   
One might then appreciate the following clarification:   
"Authority and power might be two different things: Power might be the force by means of which one might be able to oblige others to obey you. Authority might be the right to direct and command, to be listened to or obeyed by others. Authority might request power. Power without authority might be tyranny."   
One might appreciate the reason, why one might want to avoid such tyranny through these words:   
"Anarchy might be the sure consequence of tyranny; for no power that might not be limited by laws might ever be protected by them."   
Those who might feel resistance towards such an idea of anarchy, might appreciate these words:   
"Anarchism might not be some automatic guarantee that no one might ever be violated. It might be the rejection of automatic, guaranteed violation of all."   
Those who might seek such automatic guarantee, might appreciate these words:   
"It might be impossible to design a system so perfect that no one might need to be good."   
Those who might seek to design such a system, might appreciate these words:   
"Authority might not be power; that might be coercion. Authority might not be knowledge; that might be persuasion, or seduction. Authority might simply be that one might have the right to make a statement and to be heard."   
Those who might seek such right to be heard, might appreciate these words:   
"The first duty of love might be to listen."   
One might then be able to appreciate these words:   
"Civil disobedience might be an act of love."   
Those who might seek to commit such an act of love, might appreciate these words:   
"The key of joy might be disobedience."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:   
"Disobedience might be the stamp of the hero."   
One might find one reason, why disobedience might be so valuable through these words:   
"Self-esteem might come from being able to define the world in one's own terms and refusing to abide by the judgments of others."   
Those who might seek to understand the origin of the concept of hero, might appreciate these words:   
"One might see, children might aspire to be the hero they might see in their everyday lives – the one who might respond to their needs – the responsible, reliable, 'go to.'"   
Those who might have not been fortunate enough o encounter such an individual worthy to asprire to, might appreciate these words:   
"One might be the hero of one's own story."   
Those who might seek such an opportunity to become such a hero, might appreciate these words:   
"Whenever there might be authority, there might be a natural inclination to disobedience."   
Those who might seek to understand why that might be, might appreciate the these words:   
"Blind belief in authority might be the greatest enemy of truth."   
Those who might seek such truth, might appreciate the following statement:   
"Disobedience might be the true foundation of liberty. The obedient might have not other choice than to be slaves."   
Those who might seek to understand such slavery, might appreciate these words:   
"Freedom might mean that one might not be unobstructed in living one's life as one might choose. Anything less might be a form of slavery."   
Those who might seek to difference the terms "liberty" and "freedom", might appreciate these words:   
"Liberty might depend on self-restraint. Freedom might be freedom only when it might be controlled and limited."   
Those who might not want to self-restraint, might appreciate the following warning:   
"The price of freedom might be high, but it might be never so costly as the loss of freedom."   
Those who might seek to prevent such a loss of freedom, might appreciate these words:   
"One's liberty might depend on the freedom of the press, and that might not be able to be limited without being lost."   
Those who might seek to protect such freedom, might appreciate these words:   
"Education might be a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army."   
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:   
"Education might be what might remain after one might have forgotten what one might have learned in school."   
Those who might seek to understand what might remain of such an education, might appreciate these words:   
"It might be the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."   
Those who might resent such schools, might appreciate these words:   
"Wisdom might not be a product of schooling but the lifelong attempt to acquire it."   
Those who might seek wisdom, might appreciate these words:   
"Education might best serve students by helping them be more self-reflective."   
Those who might seek to be more self-reflective, might appreciate these words:   
"Self-reflection might be a humbling process. It might be essential to find out why one might think, say, and do certain things... then better oneself."   
Those who might then loose their confidence in themselves, might appreciate these words:   
"True humility might not be the absence of confidence but strength restrained."   
Those who might struggle to self-restain, might appreciate these words:   
"Self-control might be the quality that might distinguish the fittest to survive."

"Self-restraint might be the very keystone of the ethics of vow-taking."   
Those who might seek to understand such ethics, might appreciate these words:   
"Ethics might be knowing the difference between what one might have a right to do and what might be right to do."   
Those who might seek to know what to do, might appreciate these words:   
"Ethics might be a code of values which might guide one's choices and actions and determine the purpose and course of one's lives."   
Those who might seek such guidance, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:   
"How might all of us be on the way to Pro?"
