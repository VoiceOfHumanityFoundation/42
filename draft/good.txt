Thus such "inherent harm" might be amygdala inducing fear which those with mesolimbic reward system might intentially try to overcome as in:

Those who might seek to understand such shadow, might appreciate these words:   
"The shadow might be a moral trouble that might challenge the whole ego-personality, for no one might be able to become conscious of the shadow without considerable moral effort. To become conscious of it might involve recognizing the dark aspects of the personality as present and real. This act might be the essential condition for any kind of self-knowledge, and it therefore, as a rule, might meet with considerable resistance. Indeed, self-knowledge as a psychotherapuetic measure frequently might require much painstaking work extending over a long period of time."

"One might either define the moment or the moment might define one."

"One might seek not to think slightly of the paradoxical; for the paradox might be the source of the thinker's passion."

Those who seek to overcome such fear, might appreciate these words:
"Thinking might not overcome fear, but action might."   
Those who might seek to understand such action, might appreciate these words:
