One might find oneself suffering as in:   
"To define oneself, might be to suffer duality. One might have to avoid defining existence and identity."   
One might understand one reason why one might be tempted to define such existence through these words:   
"One might create stories to define one's existence. If one might not create the stories, one might probably go mad."   
Those who might seek to understand such madness, might appreciate these words:   
"To be identified with one's mind might to be trapped in time. The compulsion might arise because the past might give one an identity and the future might hold the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both might be illusions. Life might be now."   
Those who might seek to understand such life, might appreciate these words:   
"The direction of life might be from duality to unity."   
Those who might seek such unity might appreciate the chapter on "unity" and these words:

Those who might then realize such limiation of oneself, might appreciate these words:   
"One's life might be limited, but knowledge might be limitless. To drive the limited in pursuit of the limitless might be fatal; and to presume that one might really know might be fatal indeed."   
Those who might still seek to pursuit such limitless knowledge, might appreciate these words:   
"Love might be the most powerful force in the world, transcending all limits and boundaries."   
Those who might seek such love, might appreciate these words:   
"One might seek to never let the limitations or insecurities of others limit what might be possible for one."
One might understand one reason, why that might be necessary through these words:   
"One might seek to never let others define who one might be because most might be still trying to figure out who they might be."
Those who still trying to figure out who they might be, might appreciate the following definition of love:   
"Love might be the wish to give, not to receive, something."   
Those who might not know what to give, might appreciate these words:   
"The most desired gift of love might not be diamonds or chocolate. It might be focused attention."   
Those who might seek to implement such focused attention, might appreciate the following idea:

Those who might struggle to fulfill such duty, might appreciate these words:

Those who struggle with such uncertainty, might appreciate these words:   
"If uncertainty might be unacceptable to one, it might turns into fear. If it might be perfectly acceptable, it might turn into increased aliveness, alertness, and creativity."   
Those who might then seek certainty, might appreciate these words:    
"To be uncertain might to be uncomfortable, but to be certain might to be ridiculous."   
[todo add explaination]
Those who might then seek to accept such uncertainty, might appreciate these words:   
"The quality of wit might inspire more admiration than confidence."     
2. Mutual attraction (It might not only be limited to Eros, described later on, but also other qualties such as their intellect, humor, etc.) Those who seek such mutual attraction, might appreciate the following warning:

The following three might be well known distictions of love:   
1. Eros = Romantic love

"The highest form of love might be consideration."   
Those who might seek to understand such consideration, might appreciate these words:   
"Generosity might not only be about money. There might be more than one currency. One might seek to let one's generosity be pervasive in life."   
Those who might wonder what currency to give, might appreciate these words:

Those who might seek to build such emotional connection, might appreciate these words:

"The love and attention one might always have thought one might have wanted from someone else might be the love and attention one might first need to give to oneself."    
Those who might feel a sensation of abundance after one has focused on oneself might appreciate these words:   
"Self-actualization might not be able to be attained, if it might be made an end in itself, but only as a side effect of self-transcendence."   
Those who might seek to transcend oneself might appreciate the following realization:    
"Those who might seek attention, might need all the help they might be able to get."   
Those who might seek such help, might appreciate the following summery of a concept referred as "Zen" which might refer to a concept known as the "four elements of true love":
1. "Metta": Loving kindness, with which one might seek to discover the need of others, to which one might refer as "understanding".   
2. "Karuna": Compassionate love, with which one might seek to try help relieving the suffering of others.  
3. "Mudita": Joyful love, with which one might seek to enjoy together, which might be the effort to offer joy in times of need.

4. "Upeksha": Non discriminatory love, which might be inclusive and calm love.   
After one might have gained the ability to recognize such elements of "true" love, one might appreciate the warning:   
"Love might be giving someone the power to completely destroy one, and hoping that they might not."   
Those who might have recognized such destructive tendencies within oneself, might appreciate these words:

Those who might struggle with such unexpressed emotion, might appreciate these words:   
"In every moment one might have the choice to be a victim or a creator."   
Those who might be tempted to be such a victim, might appreciate these words:   
"Without effort, one's talent might be nothing more than unmet potential. Without effort, one's skill might be nothing more than what one might have done but might have not."

Those who might then be tempted by such hypocricy, might appreciate these words:   
"A strong relationship might require choosing to love each other even in those moments when one might struggle to like each other."
Those who might struggle to like each other, might appreciate the following concept of principles of love:

Mature love might follow the principe 'One might be loved because one might love'   
Immature love might say: 'One love another because one might need another.'    
Mature love might say: One might need another because one might love another."    
Those who might love another, might appreciate the following categorization into four types of attachment styles observed in infants. There might be more fine grained distinction, but one might appreciate the following simplified version:
1. Secure attachment: Might stay stable even during tough times.
2. Anxious attachment: Might seek more validation during tough times.
3. Avoidant attachment: Might seek more alone time during tough times.
4. Anxious and avoidant attachment: Might behave avoidant, but might be internally seeking for connection.

Those who might struggle to create such intimacy, might appreciate these words:

Those who might seek to reduce such distance, might appreciate the idea to prepare two dairies which might have one page for each day of the year. And then write daily what one might have sought to tell another but might not seek to disturb them. And when one might see each other, to exchange the diaries and keep writing daily in the diary of another. Those who might struggle to keep up with a daily diary entry, might appreciate the idea to address the diary entry to another who one might love, telling them what one might be grateful for, to which one might refer to as "gratitude journal".
