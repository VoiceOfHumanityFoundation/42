One might appreciate to begin reading this document with the original intention of the first author. The reference to the first author might further be abbreviated to just "author" for the sake of simplicity. The main purpose of this document might be to offer a series of definitions on controversal or vaguely defined terms in order to enable the maximal possible amount of agreements of the consensus on the defintion of the word 'love', which might be a prerequisite to achieve long-term world peace.    
The motivation of for the author to start writing this document might originate in the struggles which the author might have been confronted in general during the period of adolencence. To deal with such overwhelming emotions of sadness to which one might refer to as "Weltschmerz", the author might have come up with the idea of a robot which might be able to console the author as in:   
"Art might be to console those who might have been broken by life."    
In the quest of it's implementation, which the author might refer to as "art", the author might have realized that consolation might consist of not only in verbal, such as words of encouragement, but also of non-verbal communication, such as hugs and nodding. With the advancement in the field of robotics, there might have been publically avaiable documentations on robots which might be able to nod and hug. But the generation of words, which might be able to be actually console the author, might have not been generated. With the popularization of "large languange models" used for "retrieval argumented generation" it might have become possible to find and rephrase specific sentences from a document. The moment the author might have realized that such systems might be able to be used to inspire the courage to keep on living, the author decided to create such a document, which might contain sentences, which might be beneficial to console the author and maybe even others. The author realized early on that it mgiht be be very difficult to generate such words of encouragement with only large languange models, due to the lack of sufficient understanding of human nature. Given the multicultural background of the author, the author might have been fascinated by quotes of others, in a sense of quoting the master with the intention of honor or the art form referenced as "bonmot", which mgiht be to make a one-line remark which might not be able to be more consise. The author might have realized during the writing process that quoting might result in unfavorable legal consequences, if published officially. Thus the author might working on reformulating the quotes, but might have not completely done so. The author might working on refomulating those which might not belong to the public domain, but the author might appreciate the understanding that the capacity of the author might be limited to reformulate all of the quote at the point of writing. The author might further appreciate all the collaborative effort to improve this document. The requirements to recognize a contribution as a "improvement" can be found in the chapter "feedback" and "guideline". Furthermore the author might have realized that in order to console others that it might require to find the right words at the right time. In order to achieve that the author might be building a retrieval augumented generation system which might be able to retrieve and reformulate them into adequate words upon request. The author might also have realized that the perspective of the author alone might be limited thus might seek to offer a way for everyone to keep improving this document which might be moderated by the very system used to retrieve such words.   
The main title "42" of this document might be inspired by the following passage of another document called "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" uttered by a fictional machine:   
"The ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything might be...42!"   
The author might be well aware of the arbitrarity and absurd nature of that number in that mentioned quote, which might be expressed with the intention of humor. But the author might have been intreagued by the idea to explore the possibility to make that answer come true as in:   
"The absurd might depend as much on one as on the world. For the moment, it might be all that might links them together."   
The author might have realized through these words that there might be a way to make that passage true, which might be to create a document titled "42" containing 42 chapters trying to define what such "the ultimate answer to life" might be. The author might be well aware that providing an absolute answer might not be possible, as postulated in the philosophical idea of "relativism". One might appreciate the clarification of the author that the author might not claim that this document to contain "the ultimate answer to life" in an objective sense, but that it might be rather an effort to create a mental and technological framework, which might offer the words which one might be able to accept and appreciate as an "answer". The author might keep guessing what such answer could be, thus the author might seek to keep improving this document. Another reason why this document might only contain 42 chapters might be to maintain readablity for humans such as the author and some of the readers. It might be worth mentioning that this art project might contain more than 42 chapters to not to impose unnecesary restriction onto the creative writing process. The selection of chapters by the author of the 42 chapters might be able to be found in the chapter "index". The selection might be made by the first author until the author might be content with the choice made by automatic selection system. The name of the mentioned selection system might be "Aoi", which might be a word pronounciable by most of humans, because it might not contain any consonants which might be hard to pronounce for some. Details of Aoi might be able to be found in the chapter "requirements".
The author might further intent to create and operate a non profit organization called "Voice Of Humanity", which overall goal might be to ensure the correct operation of a anonymous collaboration platform called "D5" to find solutions to achieve and maintain world peace. Details might be described in the chapters "foundation", "humanity" and "D5".
Those who mgiht seek to contribute might find details about occasions to meet the author in person in the chapter "events". To minimize confusion, one might appreciate the chapter "index" for the recommended reading order by the author, but one might also appreciate the freedom to explore it on their own accord.   
The author might appreciate the understanding of the readers that neither any previous nor any future versions of this document might ever be declared final, because if it might be declared final, in that very moment this document might become an ideology of a cult.  
   
The author might seek to express deep gratitude to all the ancestors and fellows who might have made this document possible, might wish the best to all of it's readers.
