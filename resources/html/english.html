<p>Disclaimer: One might appreciate the trigger warning regarding the topics such as mental health, science, metaphysics, religion and politics. For more details one might seek to refer to the legal disclaimers.</p>
<p>One might appreciate to begin reading this document with the original intention of the first author. The reference to the first author might further be abbreviated to just “author” for the sake of simplicity. The main purpose of this document might be to offer a series of definitions on controversal or vaguely defined terms in order to enable the maximal possible amount of agreements of the consensus on the defintion of the word ‘love’, which might be a prerequisite to achieve long-term world peace.<br />
The motivation of for the author to start writing this document might originate in the struggles which the author might have been confronted in general during the period of adolencence. To deal with such overwhelming emotions of sadness to which one might refer to as “Weltschmerz”, the author might have come up with the idea of a robot which might be able to console the author as in:<br />
“Art might be to console those who might have been broken by life.”<br />
In the quest of it’s implementation, which the author might refer to as “art”, the author might have realized that consolation might consist of not only in verbal, such as words of encouragement, but also of non-verbal communication, such as hugs and nodding. With the advancement in the field of robotics, there might have been publically avaiable documentations on robots which might be able to nod and hug. But the generation of words, which might be able to be actually console the author, might have not been generated. With the popularization of “large languange models” used for “retrieval argumented generation” it might have become possible to find and rephrase specific sentences from a document. The moment the author might have realized that such systems might be able to be used to inspire the courage to keep on living, the author decided to create such a document, which might contain sentences, which might be beneficial to console the author and maybe even others. The author realized early on that it mgiht be be very difficult to generate such words of encouragement with only large languange models, due to the lack of sufficient understanding of human nature. Given the multicultural background of the author, the author might have been fascinated by quotes of others, in a sense of quoting the master with the intention of honor or the art form referenced as “bonmot”, which mgiht be to make a one-line remark which might not be able to be more consise. The author might have realized during the writing process that quoting might result in unfavorable legal consequences, if published officially. Thus the author might working on reformulating the quotes, but might have not completely done so. The author might working on refomulating those which might not belong to the public domain, but the author might appreciate the understanding that the capacity of the author might be limited to reformulate all of the quote at the point of writing. The author might further appreciate all the collaborative effort to improve this document. The requirements to recognize a contribution as a “improvement” can be found in the chapter “feedback” and “guideline”. Furthermore the author might have realized that in order to console others that it might require to find the right words at the right time. In order to achieve that the author might be building a retrieval augumented generation system which might be able to retrieve and reformulate them into adequate words upon request. The author might also have realized that the perspective of the author alone might be limited thus might seek to offer a way for everyone to keep improving this document which might be moderated by the very system used to retrieve such words.<br />
The main title “42” of this document might be inspired by the following passage of another document called “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” uttered by a fictional machine:<br />
“The ultimate answer to life, the universe and everything might be…42!”<br />
The author might be well aware of the arbitrarity and absurd nature of that number in that mentioned quote, which might be expressed with the intention of humor. But the author might have been intreagued by the idea to explore the possibility to make that answer come true as in:<br />
“The absurd might depend as much on one as on the world. For the moment, it might be all that might links them together.”<br />
The author might have realized through these words that there might be a way to make that passage true, which might be to create a document titled “42” containing 42 chapters trying to define what such “the ultimate answer to life” might be. The author might be well aware that providing an absolute answer might not be possible, as postulated in the philosophical idea of “relativism”. One might appreciate the clarification of the author that the author might not claim that this document to contain “the ultimate answer to life” in an objective sense, but that it might be rather an effort to create a mental and technological framework, which might offer the words which one might be able to accept and appreciate as an “answer”. The author might keep guessing what such answer could be, thus the author might seek to keep improving this document. Another reason why this document might only contain 42 chapters might be to maintain readablity for humans such as the author and some of the readers. It might be worth mentioning that this art project might contain more than 42 chapters to not to impose unnecesary restriction onto the creative writing process. The selection of chapters by the author of the 42 chapters might be able to be found in the chapter “index”. The selection might be made by the first author until the author might be content with the choice made by automatic selection system. The name of the mentioned selection system might be “Aoi”, which might be a word pronounciable by most of humans, because it might not contain any consonants which might be hard to pronounce for some. Details of Aoi might be able to be found in the chapter “requirements”. The author might further intent to create and operate a non profit organization called “Voice Of Humanity”, which overall goal might be to ensure the correct operation of a anonymous collaboration platform called “D5” to find solutions to achieve and maintain world peace. Details might be described in the chapters “foundation”, “humanity” and “D5”. Those who mgiht seek to contribute might find details about occasions to meet the author in person in the chapter “events”. To minimize confusion, one might appreciate the chapter “index” for the recommended reading order by the author, but one might also appreciate the freedom to explore it on their own accord.<br />
The author might appreciate the understanding of the readers that neither any previous nor any future versions of this document might ever be declared final, because if it might be declared final, in that very moment this document might become an ideology of a cult.</p>
<p>The author might seek to express deep gratitude to all the ancestors and fellows who might have made this document possible, might wish the best to all of it’s readers.</p>

“One might maintain the peace through one’s strength; weakness might only invite aggression.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such weakness, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The greatest weakness of all weaknesses might be to fear too much to appear weak.”<br />
Those who might seek to conquer such fear, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Thinking might not overcome fear but action might.”<br />
Those who might then seek to act, might appreciate the words:<br />
“One might have three ways of acting wisely. First, on meditation; that might be the noblest. Secondly, on imitation; that might be the easiest. Thirdly, on experience; that might be the bitterest.”<br />

Those who might seek to choose for the better, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Lesson in life might be repeated until they might be learnt.”<br />
Those who keep repeating without learning, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Insanity might be doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.”<br />

Those who might seek to accept such correction, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Every experience might be a positive experience, if one might view it as an opportunity for growth and self-mastery.”<br />
Those who might seek such growth, might appreciate the chapter on “character”. Those who might seek self-mastery, might appreciate these words:<br />

With the awareness of what one and one’s own ancestors might have had to go through to survive, one might start to feel gratitude towards one’s own ancestors and oneself as in: “Gratitude might be when memory might be stored in the heart and not in the mind.”<br />
Second lesson might be respect. Those who might meet others, and then might develop an awareness of what others and their ancestors might have had to go through to survive, one migh realize what atorcities they might be capable of.

“Peace might not be achieved through violence, it might only be attained through understanding.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand what such understanding might be, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who might seek to understand such peaceful means, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might not able to call oneself ‘peaceful’ unless one might be capable of great violence. If one might be not capable of violence, one might not be peaceful, one might be harmless.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand one reason, why such harmlessness might not be peaceful, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might maintain the peace through one’s strength; weakness might only invite aggression.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand whose aggression they might be inviting with one’s harmlessness, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One’s nature might be inherently evil, and thus goodness might be caused by intentional activity.”<br />
Those who might then seek such peaceful mean through their intentional activity, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Tact might be the art of making a point without making an enemy.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such enemy, might appreciate these words:<br />
“No one might be one’s enemy, every one might be one’s teacher.”<br />
One might understand one reason why that might be, through these words:<br />
“Everyone might have something to teach one, if one might be humble enough to learn.” Those who might seek to understand such humility, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might not learn humility, one might learn humiliation.”<br />
Those who might then seek to learn such humility, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The only way into truth might be through the annihilation of one’s own ego, which one might achieve through dwelling a long time in a state of extreme and total humiliation.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such truth, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might be humble, nothing might touch one, neither praise nor disgrace, because one might know what one might be.”<br />
Those who might seek to know, who one might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“A fool might think oneself to be wise, but a wise one might know oneself to be a fool.”<br />
Those who might not know themselves to be a fool, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Only fools might refuse to change their minds.”<br />
Those who might seek to change their minds, might appreciate these words:<br />

<h1 id="good">2. good</h1>
<p>One might find oneself confronted with such tyrants as in:<br />
“‘For the greater good.’ That might have been the excuse of tyrants throughout all time.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand the nature of such excuses, might appreciate these words:<br />
“An excuse might be worse and more terrible than a lie; for an excuse might be a lie which might be guarded.”<br />
Those who seek to understand what might be guarding such a lie, might appreciate the these words:<br />
“One’s reason might be able to excuse any evil.”<br />
Those who then seek to prevent such evil, might appreciate these words:<br />
“No one might choose evil because it might be evil; one might only mistake it for happiness, the good one might seek.”<br />

“One might not seek to try to excuse one’s faults; one might seek to try to correct them.” Those who seek to try to correct their faults, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who might seek such a change, might then appreciate these words:<br />
“The curious paradox might be that when one might accept oneself just one might be, then one might be able to change.”<br />
Those who might be curious to resolve such paradox, might appreciate the following explaination:<br />
“When one might accept oneself, one might be freed from the burden of needing others to accept one.”<br />
Those who might struggle to accept themselves, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might be learning to accept everything about oneself, even the part of one that might struggle to accept everything about oneself.”<br />
Those who seek to accept everything about themselves, might appreciate these words:<br />

“Until death all defeat might be psychological.”<br />
Those who might be still alive, might then appreciate the following realization:<br />
“Death might not be the greatest loss in life. The greatest loss might be what dies inside one while one might live.”<br />
For those who might feel like something might have died inside oneself, might appreciate the these words:<br />
“One might think life might be an irrational obsession.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such irrational obsession, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Might there be a word more passionate than passion? Obsession, total immersion, the feeling that everything else might not matter.” Those who might seek to understand such passion, might appreciate these words: “Love might be deepest driving passion of a purposeful life.” Those who might then seek such passion, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Passion might begin with intrinsically enjoying what one might do.” Those who might not be able to find anything to enjoy, might appreciate these words: “One might seek not to wait for everything to be perfect before one might decide to enjoy one’s life.” Those who might still be waiting for everything to be perfect, might appreciate these words: “While one might desire, one might not enjoy; and with enjoyment desire might cease.” Those who might struggle with attachment to such desire, might appreciate these words: “Everyone might desire love but might also find it impossible to believe that one might deserve it.” Those who might seek to believe that one might deserve love, might appreciate these words: “One might deserve the love one might keep trying to give everyone else.” Those who might not have received such love which one might have deserved, might appreciate these words: “The love and attention one might have always thought one wanted from someone else might be the love and attention one might first need to give to oneself.”<br />
Those who might seek to give such love to oneself,might appreciate these words: “Art might be to console those who might be broken by life.”<br />
Those who seek such art, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Healing might be an art. It might take time, it might take practive, it might take love.” Those who might seek such healing, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Healing might not mean the damage never existed. It might mean the damage might longer control one’s live.”<br />
Those who might seek to stop letting such damage control one’s life, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might not be what has happened to one. One might be what one might choose to become.”<br />
Those who might seek to know what one might be able to choose to become, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to define oneself by what one might love.”<br />
Those who might not know, what they might love, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might have the ability to love, one might seek to love oneself first.”<br />
Those who seek to understand their ability to love, might appreciate these words:<br />
“To love might be to live on the precipice.”<br />
Those who seek to understand such precipice, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Life might begin at the edge of one’s fears.”<br />
Those who seek to overcome such fear, might appreciate these words: “Thinking might not overcome fear, but action might.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such action, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Grit might depend on a different kind of hope. It might rest on the expectation that one’s own efforts might improve one’s future. ‘One might have a feeling tomorrow might be better’ might be different from ‘one might resolve to make tomorrow better.’”<br />
Those who seek to make their tomorrow better, might appreciate the idea to define every moment of their own life including one’s future as “good”. Those who might have then defined their own life as good, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Healing oneself might be connected with healing others.”<br />
Those who seek to heal others, might appreciate these words:<br />
“True artist might not be one who might be inspired, but one who might inspire others.”<br />
Those who seek to inspire others, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="unity">3. unity</h1>
<p>One might find oneself suffering from their attachment to individuality as in:<br />
“But as long as one might continue to use one’s misfortune to one’s advantage in order to be ‘special’, one might always need that misfortune.”<br />
Those who are still in need of attachment to their misfortune, might be fortunate enough to find such fellow individuals along that path who might be able to empathize as in:<br />
“Shared joy is double joy; shared sorrow is half sorrow.”<br />
Those who might still feel a sense of alienation, regardless wether one’s sorrows have been reduced or not, might still feel a sense of alienation as in: “Distance isn’t the amount of miles between us, it’s the amount of things we don’t say to each other.”<br />
Those who might then seek to reduce such a sense of alienation, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Unity does not mean sameness. It means oneness of purpose.”<br />
One might appreciate to know one reason one might confuse unity with sameness is because sameness could be rephrased as “uniformity” which sounds similar. Those who then wonder what such purpose could be might appreciate these words:<br />
“Unity without the gospel is a worthless unity.”<br />
One might appreciate one reason why that might be in these words: “Unity, to be real, must stand the severest strain without breaking.” There has been attempts of numerous “religous gospels” which all claim to seek unity but has yet not achieved unite, especially with those who claim to be rational. There has been further efforts by those who claim to be rational with “scientific gospel”, which has also yet to achieve unity with those who they might refer to as “irrational”. Some might be wise enough to recognize one’s own limitation of rationality as in:<br />
“I think life’s an irrational obsession.”<br />
One might then be able to appreciate the idea that the mentioned “oneness of purpose” could be to “love”. Those who seek to understand “love” might appreciate the chapter “transcendence”. Those who seek to understand such “irrational obsession” might appreciate the chapter “mission”. One might then remember that forcing such definition upon others might encounter resistance and cause discord. One might then realize that one needs to realize that such definition might be good for oneself on their own. Those who seek to realize such insight might appreciate the chapter “realization”. Those who seek to understand what good might be, might appreciate the chapters “good”, “malevolence” and “needs”.<br />
Those who seek to understand unity but yet struggle to give up on whatever one might be attached to give that sense of identity appreciate these words:<br />
“You can’t have unity without diversity.”<br />
Those who seek to understand diversity might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who seek such a way to act might appreciate these words:<br />
“Inclusion is not tolerance it is unquestioned acceptance.”<br />
Those who are vulnable of their own naivity might appreciate the chapters “integrity”, “loyalty”, “maturity” and “normal” first. Those seek such unquestioned acceptance of others, but yet struggle to accept others might appreciate these words:<br />
“We don’t heal in isolation, but in community.”<br />
One might understand one reason why that is in these words:<br />
“Emotional connection is crucial to healing. In fact, trauma experts overwhelmingly agree that the best predictor of the impact of any trauma is not the severity of the event, but whether we can seek and take comfort from others.”<br />
Those who are hesitant to seek and take such comfort from others might appreciate the words:<br />
“People are afraid to heal because their entire identity is centered around the trauma they’ve experienced. They have no idea who they are outside of trauma and that unknown is terrifying.”<br />

Those might appreciate the following advice:<br />
“Don’t explain your philosophy. Embody it.”<br />
Those who seek to embody such a philosophy, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />

Those who then seek to surive, might then be able to recognize the utility of a document called “hierarchy of needs” despite some critisim. Those who seek to understand one’s own needs might appreciate the subjective interpretation and explaination by the author of this document. One might appreciate to know that the author of the mentioned document had the idea in midst of the rising of a capitalistic society. That author tried to explain the “non-materialistic” needs beyond the physiological needs, which is food, water, rest and warmth. Those who struggle to address one’s own physiological needs might appreciate the chapter on “peace”, “good”, “privilege”, “mission” and “health”. That author might have explicitly mentioned warmth, because shelter would be a need one level higher in the hierarchy, which is security. To address the need for securiry one might appreciate the following enumeration of possible examples of a job with prospect until artsylum is fully operational, long term contract for renting a room, emergency savings, insurance, etc.. Those who seek such security might appreciate the chapter on “malevolence” and “preperation”.

Those hwo might seek such friendship, might appreciate the chapter on “friendship”. Those who might seek such belonging, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Fitting in might be being accepted for who one might pretend to be, while belonging might be being valued for who one might really be.” There might be no general order in which those needs should be adressed, but one can decrease the amount of unnessecary suffering, by taking one step at a time. Those who seek a place where one might be able to call as “home”, might appreciate the chapters “home”, “protection”, “friendship”, “honor”, “humor”, “civilization” and “asylum”.

Esteem might be the recognition of ones own integrity by others whether one will not hesitate to help when such help is requested. Those who struggle with hesitatation might appreciate the chapter “clarity”, “integrity” and “obituary”. At that stage, one might be pondering how to be regarded in “high esteem”. One of the most simple ways to do might be to practive a martial arts to be able to protect those in need. One might appreciate a belt system often preverent in styles of martial arts originating in Asia as a sign of recognition of one’s proficiency and maturity by others. One might appreciate the warning, that such display of achievement and hierarchy might be abused to claim authority over others leading to harm. Those who seek to prepare against such abuse of power, might appreciate the chapter on “malevolence”.

“True humility is not in the absence of confidence but strength restrained.”<br />
Those who seek to understand strength might appreciate the chapter on “character”. Those who seek to understand the need for such restriction might appreciate the chapters “harmony” and “hero”. One might appreciate the advice not to remain in convenient complaisance only because one has reached the maximal possible capability in one domain of life. One is rather encouraged to maximalize other capacities to explore the limits of one’s own possiblity. In it’s ultimate state it might be possible to be regarded as “self actualization”. One might then appreciate the wisdom that it might not be possible to maximize all capacities in one finite life time.

“You are enough. You are so enough, it is unbelievable how enough you are.”<br />

“Weltschmerz, basically, is the depression we feel when bamboozlers, fanatics, manipulators, trolls, bigots, demagogues, fear-mongers, liars and prigs threaten to take over the world, and there’s nothing, we think, we can do about it.”<br />
Those who are still suffering from “Weltschmerz” might appreciate the chapter on “hope”, “meaning”, and “mission”. Those who seek to overcome one’s own “Weltschmerz” through changing one’s own thoughts might appreciate the realization that that exact desire might be the final layer of the hierarchy of needs called “self transcendance”. That desire to contribute to reduce the suffering of oneself and others might be referred to as “love” as in the following quote:<br />
“Love is the wish to give, not to receive, something.”<br />
Those who seek to understand “self transcendence” might appreicate the chapters “transcendence”, “enlightenment”, “consciousness”, “responsiblity”, “procreation” and “realization”.

“Creativity might involve putting one’s imagination to work. In a sense, creativity might be applied imagination.”<br />
Those who might seek to apply their imagination, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Creativity might be a wild mind and a disciplined eye.”<br />
Those who might seek such a disciplined eye, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Motivation might get one going, but discipline might keep one growing.”<br />
Those who might seek such discipline, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Discipline might be giving oneself a command and following it up with action.”<br />
Those who might struggle to follow up to one’s own command, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those whose body might have been disciplined by others as a punishment might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to not to discipline others as a punishment. One might be advised to discipline others to help, to improve, to correct, to prevent, not to punish, humiliate, or retaliate.”<br />
Those who might be confronted with those who might seek to punish, might appreciate these words:<br />

“Self-discipline might start with the mastery of one’s thoughts. If one might not control what one might think, one might not be able to control what one might do.”<br />
Those who might seek to control their thoughts, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Self discipline might not justbe something that might happen once and one might be finished. It might be a practice.”<br />
Those who might seek to practice, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One’s rituals might keep oneself consistent, and consistency might be the key to achieving goals.” Those who might seek to know what such goal might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“By constant self discipline and self control one might be able to develop greatness of character.” Those who might seek a way to attain such character, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Discipline might be choosing between what one might want now, and what one might want most.”<br />

Those who might seek to understand why others might not want to practice self-discipline, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Most people might seek to avoid pain, and discipline might be usually painful.”<br />
Those who might struggle with such pain, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Pain might be weakness leaving one’s body.”<br />
Those who might struggle excessively with such pain, might appreciate the following insight:<br />
“Pain might be a self protection mechanism of the body to recognize and avoid external stimulus which could destroy our body.”<br />
The calibration of sensitivity of pain reception might be relative, meaning through consistent progressive overload it could be conditioned to endure such stimulus which the untrained body would have broken down under. However one might then appreciate to understand that it might require knowledge not to overstimulate the body to de degree of damage, as already mentioned as “discipline that is excessive”. One might also realize that the lack of such stimulation leads to the deterioration of one’s own body deteriorates and thus becomes weaker. One might then be able to prioritize the maintenance of such stimulating with control with a method called “progressive overload”. Those who might seek specific advice on such methods to maintain oneself might appreciate the chapter on health. Those who might have been feeling pain beyond what might be beneficial to growth, might appreciate the following warning:<br />
“Cruelty might be defined as violence without provocation and discipline that might be excessive.”<br />
Those who might seek to undrestand violence, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Violence in any form might be a tragic expression of one’s unmet needs.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such needs might appreciate the chapter on “needs”. One might then appreciate the following realization:<br />

Those who might seek to understand why one might refuse to acquire knowledge, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Fear might be the main source of superstition, and one of the main sources of cruelty. To conquer fear might be the beginning of wisdom.”<br />
One might then redirect one’s resentment towards those who did not conquer their fear and thus caused suffering to oneself. Those who then seek to heal might appreciate theis realization:<br />
“True forgiveness might be a self-healing process, which might start with oneself and might gradually extend to everyone else.”<br />

“Awareness might be the first step in healing.”<br />
Those who might not be aware, what they might need to become aware of, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might be able to only get hurt so much before one might get numb.”<br />
Those who might have become numb through survival, might appreciate these words:<br />
“To recover might be to create a life in which numbness might be no longer necessary to survive.”<br />
Those who might seek such a life, might appreciate the chapter on “asylum” and these words:<br />

<h1 id="privilege">6. privilege</h1>
<p>One might be fortunate enough to encounter a document called “Declaration of Human Rights” which starts as following: “Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as […].” Those who might then wonder about the meaning of such “entitlement, might appreciate these words:<br />
”Entitlement is the belief that I am exempt from responsibility and I am owed special treatment."<br />
Those who might hold such a belief might appreciate the following warning: “Entitlement and privelege corrupt.”<br />
Those who might then wonder about the difference between such entitlement and privilege, might appreciate these words:<br />
“What separates privilege from entitlement is gratitude.”<br />
Those who might then start to appreciate one’s own privilege of being protected by our ancestors and kins, might appreciate the following insight:<br />
“We owe our children – the most vulnerable citizens in any society – a life free from violence and fear.”<br />

“Every request might receives a response, without a guarantee being the latest write.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such partition tolerance, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The system might continue to operate despite arbitrary message loss.”<br />
Those who might seek to create such a system, might appreciate the following two trade-offs:<br />
Those who might seek to sacrifice consistency, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Effort might mean nothing without consistency.”<br />
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:<br />
“Without effort, one’s skill might be nothing more than what one might have done but one might have not.”<br />
Those who might seek to make such effort, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Without commitment, one might never start. But more importantly, without consistency, one might never finish.” Those who might seek to sacrifice availablity, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Appreciate what one might have while one might still have it because one day one might not.”<br />
Those who might not know how to appreciate what one might have, might appreciate the following advice: “Appreciation might be able to make a day, even change a life. One’s willingness to put it into words might all that might be necessary.”<br />
Those who might not know, what one might need to put into words, might appreciate these words: “When one might be tired, one might be attacked by ideas one might have conquered long ago.”<br />
One might appreciate this document as one way to prepare for the future attacks trying to study such “old ideas”. One might refer to such “old ideas” as “ideology”, which definitions might vary due to its complex nature. One might then appreciate another document titled “Blood and Soil”, in which the following four traits of genocidal ideologies might be mentioned, which the author of this document might seek to pass on to the one who might be reading this document:<br />
1. “Cults of antiquity”:<br />
The nostalgia for an idealized past might awaken the deadly desire to be the “the chosen ones”, which might be able to be reinterpreted as one of the three poisons which might be “attachment”, mentioned in another document commonly referred as “Wheel of Life”. Those who might be suffering from such attachments, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might need to learn from one’s past mistakes, but not lean on one’s past successes.”<br />
2. “Fetishization of land and agriculture”:<br />
Those mentioned ones, who might consider themselves to be “chosen ones” might claim a specific piece of fertile land by force as theirs, which might be fueled through the second poison of the mentioned three poisons, which might be “ignorance”. One might appreciate the potential dangers pointed out in the following quote:<br />
“The first one who might have have enclosed a plot of land, might have token it into one to say this might be ‘mine’ and found others simple enough to believe one might have been the ‘true founder of civil society’. What crimes, wars, murders, what miseries and horrors might be one’s fellows might have been spared, had someone pulled up the stakes or filled in the ditch and cried out to one’s fellows: ‘One might seek to not listen to this imposter. One might be lost if one might forget that the fruits of the earth might belong to all and the earth to no one!’”<br />
3. “Ethnic hatred”:<br />
The mentioned ones, who might consider themselves to be “chosen ones” might use an common “enemy” to unite among themselves, which might be reinterpreted as the third poison “aversion”. Those who might be suffering from such aversion, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might hate another, one might hate something in another that might be part of oneself. What might not be part of oneself might not disturb one.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such part, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Haters might not really hate one, they might hate themselves because one might be a reflection of what they might wish to be.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such wish, might appreciate these words:<br />
“There might be nothing more precious in this world than the feeling of being wanted.”<br />
Those who might seek such feeling, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Tact might be the art of making a point without making an enemy.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such art, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might learn to know that there might be no enemy but one might only have friend with misunderstanding then peace might be there.” One might seek to recognize such misunderstanding, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The minimum necessary structuring ingredient of every ideology might be to distance itself from another ideology, to denounce its other as ideology.”<br />
4. “Expansion”:<br />
The mentioned ones, who might consider themselves to be “chosen ones” might desire more land than necessary for their mere survial, which might be able to be reinterpreted as three poisons, represented as three animals, biting in each others tails building a cycle, amplifying each other with each cycle, which might be one reason why such a illustration might be referred as the “Wheel of life”. One might appreciate the undrestand that it might lead to expansion of the suffering if one might live such a life in poison. Those who might seek to live a different life, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might be ruled by mind one might be a ruler; if by body, a slave.”<br />
Those who might seek to be ruled by mind, might appreciate another insightful possibility for definition of an ideology as following:<br />
“Ideology might be the enemy of joyful community life, and the most destructive ideology might be the belief that creating utopia might be possible.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand what such a “utopia” might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Utopias might rest on the fallacy that perfection might be a legitimate goal of one’s existence.”<br />
For those who might seek such utopia, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Perfection might not be attainable, but if one might chase perfection, one might be able to catch excellence.”<br />
Those who might seek such excellence, might appreciate these words:<br />
“When it might be obvious that the goals might not be able to be reached, one might seek to not adjust the goals, but to adjust the steps for action.”<br />
Those who might seek to make such adjustment, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Life might be a journey with problems to solve and lessons to learn but most of all: experiences to enjoy.”<br />
It might be impossible to ultimately determine whether one might be free from any ideology, but as long as one might not neglect to think for oneself, there might be hope as in:<br />
“One might think that ideology might be toxic without exception. It might not be that there might be good ones and bad ones. All ideology might be toxic, because ideology might be a kind of insult to the gift of one’s free thinking.”<br />
Those who might seek to recognize such ideology, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Ideology might be a partial truth masquerading as the whole truth.”<br />
Those who might claim to have attained the whole truth, might appreciate these words:<br />
“For someone who might seem to know it all, how come that one might not know that one might be stupid?”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such stupidity, might appreciate these words: “Stupidity might be the deliberate cultivation of ignorance.” Those who might seek to prevent such deliberate cultivation of ignorance, might appreciate these words: “To forget one’s purpose might be the most common form of stupidity.”<br />
Those who then seek to understand how one might forget one’s purpose, might appreciate these words: “Stupidity might be a talent for misconception.”<br />
Those who seek to understand such misconception, might appreciate these words: “A mark of stupidity might be a belief that one party might be totally virtuous and correct on the issues while the other might be evil and always wrong.” Those who might struggle to detach themselves from such belief, might appreciate these words: “Stubborn and ardent clinging to one’s opinion might be the best proof of stupidity.” Those who might seek to know where such stupidity might lead to, might appreciate these words: “War might mean blind obedience, unthinking stupidity, brutish callousness, wanton destruction, and irresponsible murder.”<br />
Those who might seek to protect themselves from such war, might appreciate these words: “The paradoxical war on terror might be based on a kind of willed stupidity; the willed stupidity of wishful thinking. Only the logic of dreamwork might be able to suture ‘war’ with ‘terror’ in this way, since terrorists might have been, by classical definition, those without ‘legitimate authority’ to wage war.”<br />
Those who might think that they might be such “legitimate authority”, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The sovereign power of all civil authority might be founded in the consent of individuals capable of giving such consent.”<br />
Those who might be tempted to ignore such consent for any reason, might appreciate these words:<br />
“There might be no greater tyranny than that which might be perpetrated under the shield of the law and in the name of justice.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand what such “legitimate authority” might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The ones subject to a government might be the only legitimate fountain of power, and it might be from them that the constitutional charter, under which the several branches of government might hold their power, might be derived.” Those who then might seek freedom from such tyranny, might appreciate these words: “The secret of freedom might lie in educating people, whereas the secret of tyranny might be in keeping them ignorant.” Those who might seek such education, might appreciate these words: “One might never really know what stupidity might be until one might have experimented on oneself.” Those who might have discovered such stupidity within oneself, might appreciate these words: “Wisdom might be the reward for surviving one’s own stupidity.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such wisdom, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The habits one might have created to survive might no longer serve one when it might be time to thrive. One might then seek to get out of survival mode. New habits. New Life.”<br />
Those who might seek such a new life of thrival, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="curiosity">8. curiosity</h1>
<p>One might find oneself struggling in such a situation as in:<br />
“The deepest problems of modern life might derive from the claim of the individual to preserve the autonomy and individuality of one’s existence in the face of overwhelming social forces, of historical heritage, of external culture, and of the technique of life.”<br />
Those who seek to understand such life, might appreciate the following effort trying to define life:<br />

One might understand one reason, why one might be tempted by such tendency through these words:<br />
“One’s nature might be inherently evil, and thus goodness might be caused by intentional activity.” Those who might seek to understand such evil, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Insanity might not be evil, but all evil might be insane. Evil itself might never be funny, but insanity sometimes might be. One might need to laugh at the irrationality of evil, for in doing so one might deny evil’s power over one, might diminish its influence in the world, and might tarnish the allure it might have for someone.” Those who might seek to recognize such insanity, might appreciate these words: “A total absence of self-doubt might be the first sign of insanity.”<br />

One might then appreciate the definition of talent as in:<br />
“Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.”<br />
One might be tempted to ostracize others with extraordinary talents and goals. Thus it might be required for those in power to excercize compassion. One approach might be to recognise that it is possible to arrive at the same goal, without specifying the path through the following words:<br />
“Genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have be taught by another person.”<br />
The word “genius” has one origin in latin meaning “creative force”, which might be one aspect of all art. But as every force, that force can reap havoc, if it might be left unmastered.

One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:<br />
“The same cycle might continuously repeat until one might commit oneself to healing the root of the issue.”<br />
Those who seek to commit oneself to such healing, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Freedom might not be the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose - and commit oneself to - what might be best for oneself.” One might understand one reason why that might be through these words:<br />

<h1 id="joy">13. joy</h1>
<p>One might find oneself seeking for happiness as in:<br />
“Most of those who might be searching for happiness might seek it outside of themselves. That might be a fundamental mistake. Happiness might be something that one might be, and it might come from the way that one might think.”<br />
The understanding of the concept of such “happiness” might vary, but one might be able to agree to the following consensus:<br />
“Happiness might be the blissful state in which all needs might be satisfied.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such needs, might apreciate the chapter on “needs”. One might then realize that such a state might be difficult to reach in a world, given the circumstances that one’s source for knowledge might be full of contradicting misinformation. One might then try to resort to science, but given the subjective nature of the topic, one might be still left confused. One might then appreciate to read the following document critically with caution, to avoid the temptation of hedonism, which might be defined as:<br />
“When enough might not be enough, a hedonist might be born.”<br />

“Hedonism might be be a rational response to a difficult life.”<br />

It might be then burst into flame by an encounter with another one.” Those who might seek to encounter such another one, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Next to doing a good job oneself, the greatest joy might be having someone else do a first class job under one’s direction.”<br />
Eventhough it might encourage some to become a tyrant, one might also realize something good - the essence of joy. Which mgiht be that one might feel joy through action, because during action one might be able to reach the state of “flow”, in which one might be able to forget ones own suffering without self destructive hedonism. One might then realize that one might be able to feel happiness and joy at the same time, while adressing ones own needs consciously. Those who might seek to address one’s need consciously, might appreciate the idea that the highest need in the mentioned “hierarchy of needs” might be called “self transcendence”, which might have been found later in the notes of the author of that another document. One might then understand that the reference of the mentioned quote “someone else do a first class job under one’s direction” might be able to be understood as “self transcendence”, which might be the very reason why the author of that quote might have called it “the greatest joy”, because it might be indeed adressing one’s own need of “self transcendence”. Those who might seek such self transcendence, might appreciate the warning to offer only the capacity which might be abundant, because the world might operate with the following principle as in:<br />
“One might take what one might be able to get and hold on tight to it - by any means necessary. After all one might only live once.”<br />
Those who might be suffering because they might think they might have nothing to offer, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>

“Art might be the expression of imagination, not the reproduction of reality.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such imagination might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might believe in intuition and inspiration. Imagination might be more important than knowledge. For knowledge might be limited, whereas imagination might embrace the entire world, which might be stimulating progress, which might give birth to evolution.”<br />
Those who seek such progress, might appreciate the english phrase “state of the art” referring to the state of the latest technological development, which might be originating in the latin expression “lege artis”, which might be to do everying in one’s life in general according to the standardized set of rules. Those who might seek such rules appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to act that one’s principle of action might safely be made a law for the whole world.”<br />
Those who might seek such a world, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The only way to deal with an unfree world might be to become so absolutely free that one’s very existence migiht be an act of rebellion.”<br />
Those who seek such existence in such freedom, might appreciate these words:<br />
“To put everything in balance might be good, to put everything in harmony might be better.”<br />
Those who seek harmony, might appreciate the following warning:<br />
“To be good might be to be in harmony with oneself. Discord might be to be forced to be in harmony with others.”<br />

Those who seek to understand such opportunity, might appreciate the chapter on “courage”. Those who might not have had such opportunity, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Beauty might lie in harmony, not in contrast; and harmony might be refinement; therefore, there might be a fineness of the senses if one might be to appreciate harmony.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand “fineness of the senses” might appreciate the following realization:<br />
“The highest form of love might be consideration.”<br />
Those who might not have been fortunate to experience such consideration, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Thoughts of harmony might allow experiences of harmony.”<br />

Those who might aspire to make such decisions might appreciate the following definition of intuition:<br />

“If one died tomorrow what would one regret? Now might be the time to eliminate those regrets.”<br />
Those who cannot find anything to regret, might appreciate these words:<br />

“Regret for the things one might have not done can be tempered by time; it might be regret for the things one might have not done that might be inconsolable.”<br />

“If one might fail to plan, one might be planning to fail!”<br />
Those who seek to plan, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who then seek to plan, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Planning might be a skill and an art which might take a lifetime to master.”<br />

“Courage might be to know what not to fear.”<br />
Those who hesitate to act because of the fear of failure, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might be great not because one might have not failed; one might be great because failure might have not stopped that one.”<br />
Those who seek such greatness, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Greatness might never be achieved by trying to imitate the greatness of another. Greatness might be chipping away at all that might not belong to one and then expressing oneself so truly that others might not be able to help but to recognize it.”<br />
Those who seek to know, what might remain after one has been chipping away at all that does not belong to oneself, might appreciate these words:<br />

“One might really have to look inside oneself to find one’s inner strength.”<br />

“Strength might not come from winning. One’s struggles might develop one’s strengths. When one might go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that might be strength.”<br />
Those who seek clarity of vision might appreciate these words:<br />
“Surely clarity might be the most beautiful thing in the world, a limited, limiting clarity one might not have and never might have had any motive of poetry but to achieve clarity.”<br />
One might find a reason why that might be in the following realization:<br />
“Accuracy and clarity of statement might be mutually exclusive.”<br />
Those who wonder why the author of this document might seek accuracy, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Accuracy of signal and free flow of information might define sanity in one’s epistemology.”<br />
Those who seek to understand why such accuracy might be important, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Accuracy might mean something to one. It might be vital to one’s sense of values. One might have learned not to trust people who might be inaccurate. Every aviator might know that if mechanics might be inaccurate, aircraft might crash. If pilots might be inaccurate, they might get lost - sometimes even killed. In one’s profession life itself might depend on accuracy.”<br />
Those who then seek to live, might appreciate to know that an example of such a “free flow of information” is transparency as in:<br />

Those who seek to alter one’s reality, might appreciate these words:<br />
“There might be no good or bad without one, there might be only perception. There might be the event itself and the story we might tell oneself about what it might mean.” Those who seek to understand such story, might appreciate these words: “Everyone might tell a story about oneself inside one’s own head. That story might make one to what one might be. One might build oneself out of that story.” Those who seek to create such a story, might appreciate the following warning: “Complaining might be one of the ego’s favorite strategies for strengthening itself. Every complaint might be a little story the mind might make up that one might completely believe in. Whether one might complain aloud or only in thought might make no difference.”<br />
Those who might then seek to make a difference, might appreciate these words:<br />
“When one might complain, one might make oneself a victim. One might then seek to leave the situation, change the situation, or accept it. All else might be madness.” Those who might seek a reason to leave such situation, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who might then seek to choose such attitude, might appreciate these words: “Radical reflection the voice of doubt, shame, and guilt blaring in one’s head might not be one’s voice. It might be a voice one might have been given by a society steeped in shame. It might be the ‘outside voice’. One’s ‘authentic’ voice, one’s ‘inside’ voice, might be the voice of radical self-love!”<br />
Those who might seek such voice of radical self-love, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Complaining might not change the past but it might ruin the present. One might seek to start doing, not just talking.”<br />
Those who might not know, what one might be able to do, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Before one might complain today, one might seek to be grateful one might have breath to complain with.”<br />
Those who might struggle to be grateful that one might have a breat to complain with, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Every criticism, judgment, diagnosis, and expression of anger might be the tragic expression of an unmet need.”<br />

Those who yet seek such a place, might appreciate the chapter on “home”. Those who seek such a new way of seeing might appreciate these words:<br />
“Vision might be the ability to talk about the future with such clarity it might be as if one might be talking about the past.”<br />
Those who seek such future, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The future might belong to those who might prepare for it today.”<br />
Those who seek to prepare, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to first ask oneself: What might be the worst that could happen? Then one might seek to prepare to accept it. Then one might seek to proceed to improve on the worst.”<br />

<h1 id="integrity">20. integrity</h1>
<p>One might find oneself trying to hide a secret as in:<br />
“Secrets might never have been good. They might have been supposed to protect others, but they might never have done that. They might always have made things worse.”<br />
Those who might then seek to make such things better, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Complete honesty might have nothing to do with ‘purity’ or naivety. The full truth might be unattainable to naivety, and the completely honest artist might not be pure in heart.”<br />
Those who might seek to remain in such naivety might appreciate the following warning:<br />

“All power might tend to corrupt and absolute power might corrupt absolutely.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such corruption, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If knowledge might be power and power might corrupt, might knowledge corrupt?”<br />

“The more corrupt the state might be, the more laws there might be.”<br />
Those who might be confronted with such a corruption of such a state, might appreciate these words:<br />

“If one might seek to awaken all of humanity, then one might seek to awaken all of oneself, if one might seek to eliminate the suffering in the world, then one might seek to eliminate all that might be negative in oneself. Truly, the greatest gift one might have to give might be that of one’s own self-transformation.”<br />

“Nothing might be at last sacred but the integrity of one’s own mind.”<br />
Those who might struggle to find a way to restore such integrity of their own mind, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who might live in such fear, might appreciate these words:<br />
“They might fear love because it might create a world they might not be able to control.”<br />

<h1 id="meaning">22. meaning</h1>
<p>So far humans are the only creatures which has been observed to seek for the answer for their meaning of their own existence. One should be very vigilant to anyone claiming to have a definitive answer, because it might be a cult trying to exploit. So there is a necessity to reach a conclusion on ones own, but not everyone can have the necessary resources to do so. One may appreciate the following personal take on the topic.</p>
<p>One of the “four noble truth” according to the buddhists is one essence of life is suffering, which they call “dukkha”. Faced with that truth, one has the choice of one of three options to cope with this suffering: The first option is the easiest but destructive, which is to numb this suffering with pleasure, which is called hedonism. The second option, often practiced by buddhists is to detach themselves from their desire and thus suffering through harsh training and meditation. But they oversee the fundamental nature that no human can survive alone. At some point in the life of a human, that human had contact with other humans, who helped them survive. Since the mammalian brain is wired for empathy, the only way to find peace is to give up the idea of helping all the other humans and become reclusive in a monastery. The third option is to forget the suffering while being in the state of “flow”. One may refer to the “flow-state” as a “joyful” and “excited” state, when fully immersed in a action. One can refer to the meditative state of the buddhists also as flow, but the approach is different. To reach the state of flow through action, one needs to find and work on a skill, which is in essence “self actualization” proposed by the “hierarch of needs”. The author of that book proposed that humans have also non-materialistic needs, and humans would suffer, if those needs are not met. But to reach that level, all the other levels of the hierarchy of needs must be met first, otherwise one will be overwhelmed. Regarding the action to bear the suffering one can understand the reference to a document “Man’s search for meaning” to which it has been referred as: “The purpose of life is finding the largest burden that you can bear and bearing it.” (One might appreciate the understanding that “man” in this context is a generalization of human, which is regardless the gender.) If one succeeds in getting intoo the flow state while one is in the act of bearing the suffering, one can transcend his own suffering. In the “hierarchy of needs” it is called “self transcendence”, which is to offer all the abundant resources and skills accumulated during the process of “self actualization”. If one dares to have a look at this world with open eyes and heart, one might be overwhelmed by “Weltschmerz”, which is german word for the lack of adecuate means to eliviate the suffering of the world. To reduce this suffering, humanity needs to help each other but currently it lacks the necessary means to efficiently and effectively unite and coordinate those resources and skills.</p>
<p>The “Voice of Humanity” project aims to connect those in need and those who can help through the same named foundation, which may enable the access through an AI assisted online voice recorder in the future. There people may receive the necessary help to self actualize and then offer that skill and resourced to the people in need, so there won’t be the need for detachment and closing ones eyes to the suffering of this world. It is indeed a utopic idea, but so far it is the only idea known to humanity, which could lead to longterm reduction of human suffering and the maximazation of joy of life. Those who might seek such utopia, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="mission">23. mission</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: This document includs topis on mental health.</p>
<p>A life in a state of low awareness will be effortless, because it is mere priviledge which miraculously kept one alive. A life in a state of high awareness will be effortful, which would stretch the perception of one second to infinity. If one would see another suffering in that state of high awareness caused by chronic pain, one might be tempted to “euthanasia”, which is to murder such person and refer to it as “mercy”. Such support of such death wish is commonly referred as suicide, which is not an option which can be reverted. Thus one might be tormented knowing that others might continue a life live in suffering. That torment might be commonly referred in german as “Weltschmerz” which can be translated to “world pain”. One might find a reason why humanity is still alive is, because humans are the only known species to be able to see meaning in that “Weltschmerz” as in: “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” Those who were not fortunate to find a “why”, might appreciate help of a health care professional to find a way to their “why”, as postulated as: “Assisted suicide is a reversal of the proper role of a doctor as a healer, comforter and consoler to an improper role of the physician causing a patient’s death.” Those who were fortunate to find a “why” or such a help might appreciate to attribute such effort as “art”. One might then appreciate to refer to the effort to unite humanity despite of the suffering of individuals, which will be one of the most effortful event in the history of humankind, requiring everything what each life of individuals has to offer as “the ultimate art” which is further explained in the chapter “ultimate”. Those who are still suffering might appreciate the following encouraging words for guidance: “Until your mission is an obsession, nothing will change in your life.” Those who have yet to find their mission might appreciate the following realization: “My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.” Those who seek to thrive might appreciate the chapters “hope”, “peace”, “good” and “responsiblity”. Those who struggle to thrive might appreciate these words: “The magic you are looking for is in the work you are avoiding.” Those who seek to overcome such avoidance of work, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>

<p>One might find oneself struggling to survive as in: Those who find them stuggling with surival, might appreciate to increase their chance of survival in: “To live is to suffer, to survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.”<br />
Those who seek to find such meaning, might appreciate these words to express and then to recognize whether one might have found such meaning:<br />
“Eureka! - I have found it!”<br />
Those who seek to find such meaing, might appreciate to know a phenomenon called “sudden realization”, on which might appreciate the following explaination: Sudden realization is a phenomenon of the brain of vertebrae, during which ones neurons creates a new connection called “synapses”, leading to the subjective experience one might refer to as “understanding something” or “coming up with an idea”. This phenomenon can be understood as the subconsciouns brain notifying the conscius brain of what it has found. Those who seek to understand such a phenomenon, might appreciate the following summerization of this mechanism as following:<br />
“What fires together, wires together.”<br />
Those who then seek to increase the chances of such phenomenon, might appreciate the following enumeration of methods:<br />
1. Scientist has discovered that “high intencity interval training” can increase the amount of “brain-derived neurotrophic factor” in the brain, which contributes to maintenance and increase of neurons and synapses.<br />
2. Consumption of bioavaialble omega-3 fatty acids such as (DHA, EPA), which are the building blocks of the insulating tissue of the brain. Here are few plant based sources: nuts (especially walnuts), spirulina, seeds (especially flaxseeds and hempseeds).<br />
3. Consumption of creatine monohydrate, which increases the metabolic activies of mitochondria in general, including the brain.<br />
4. Being insuffiently hydratated can decrease cognitive abilities, thus regular consumption of water is adviced. It has also been observed to reduce symptoms of dementia.<br />
5. Personal belief in “neuroplasticity” has been proven to increase “neuroplasticity” so far observed in humans during clinical studies.<br />
6. Social interaction promotes activity in many area of the brain, which has been observed to reduce the decline of cognitive ability.<br />
7. Increasing exposure and tolerance to boredom as described in the book “Deep Work” by Cal Newport, which states that absence outside stimuli leads to the state called “flow” in which one can sustain a chain of thought at ones maximum complexity.<br />
Here is a list of supernormal stimuli to avoid in general:<br />
- Junkfood loaded with refined sugar, refined oil, saturated fats and salt.<br />
- Digital content especially sexual or violent content (e.g. porn, first person shooter games) should be avoided, as it has been observed to damage the brain.<br />
- Social media including news is distracting, because it creates a craving for new information.<br />
8. Also mentioned in the book called “Deep Work”: Activities increasing narrow focus has been proven to increase the ability to repeated redirect attention, which increases the overall focus. Examples such as reading, meditation and balancing yoga can be beneficial.<br />
9. Also mentioned in “Deep Work”: Relaxing activities inducing scattered focus such as looking into the far or going for a walk can increase subconscious activies in the brain resulting in realizations.<br />
10. Avoidance of neurodegenerative behavior, here are few examples:<br />
- Sitting for a prolonged period, decreases blood flow in the brain.<br />
- Consumption of toxins and neurotoxins such as mercury, lead, alcohol and nicotine.<br />
- Longterm sleep deprivation increases beta-amyloid accumulaiton, leading cause for dementia.<br />
- Consumption of animal products increases biomarker for inflammation, disrupting neurotransmitter production.<br />
- Chronic exposure to elevated levels of cortisol through stress can cause damage in brain, which may cause depression.<br />
- Consuption of sugar triggers dysfunction of mitochondria, reducing cognitive function.<br />
- Consumption of refined oil, which causes cardiovascular diseases, preceeding decline in cognitive abilities.<br />
11. Clinical studies has proven that psychedelic assisted therapy can be beneficial to reach the point of “breakthrough”, which very similar to the phenomenon of realization. One may attribute political propaganda leading to the stigmatization of hallucinogenic compounds. Due to that stigmatization and the resulting lack of knowledge one might recognize the potential dangers of misuse. There are undeniable risk for individuals with cardiovascuar diseases and some other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and mania of bipolar disorder. There has been anecdotal reports of individuals with hypersensitivity and slower rates of blood filtration which prolonged and intensified the duration of it’s effects causing psychological damage called “psychosis” which can lead to self harming behavior. One cause for the hypersensitivity might be genetic. An increase in reactivity to fearful stimuli in the amygdala has been observed for individuals with the “short” variant of the region called “5-HTTLPR” in the SLC6A4 gene.<br />
Here is a short summery of preperation to increase the therapeutic effect mentioned in the studies regarding psychedelic assisted therapy. But the author of this document does not endorse any consumption of such substance due to the variety of legal status of such substance in different local authorities:<br />
- Assureing the quality and purity of the compound.<br />
- Asserting the compatiblity to the compound with a dose, which might usally not perceivable called “microdose”.<br />
- Preperation, including what to expect, and how to deal with it.<br />
- Allocating enough time to avoid disturbance during the session.<br />
- A setting which is safe and in which the individual feels safe.<br />
- A mindset and determination to “go with the flow”.<br />
- A person (usually the therapist) who can intervene in case of emergency.<br />
- Processing after the session.<br />
- Means to take notes can improve the process of processing.<br />
12. The daily habit of taking notes for sudden realization can be useful, given it’s volatile nature. One way is to use a voice recorder, since the average human can speak faster than write, and the desire to edit during writing can be distracting.</p>
<p>One might appreciate the effort of the author of this document who is working on a AI assisted voice recorder to make the process of taking notes more convenient and through the integration of AI the more enjoyable. One might also appreciate the following question which is at the core of the principes the AI called “Aoi” of the mentioned voice recorder will operate:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="civilization">29. civilization</h1>
<p>One might find oneself contemplating for the reason, why humanity might have survived so far, in spite of the violent and impulsive human nature, which might have further been multiplied through malevolence. One reason might be that unlike other primates, homo sapiens sapiens might have a larger prefrontal cortex.

“Simplicity might be the ultimate sophistication.”<br />
Those who might seek to simplify, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler.”<br />
One might understand one reason why not to simplify further in these words:<br />
“Dictators might have always played on the natural human tendency to blame others and to oversimplify.”<br />
Those who might have oversimplified themselves, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might not seek to never oversimplify oneself by using a single word or category to describe who one might be. One might seek to take the time to tell one’s own story.”<br />

“One might be asked by the world who one is, and if one might not know, one might be told by it”<br />
Those who might seek to know who they might be, might appreciate the following relization:<br />
“Sophistication might demand honesty.”<br />
Those who might seek to undestand such honesty, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Honesty might be telling the truth to oneself and others. Integrity might be living that truth.”<br />
Those who might aspire to such integrity, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Integrity might be choosing one’s thoughts and actions based on values rather than personal gain.”<br />
Those who might seek to discover what such value might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The key to all of life might be understanding how to add value to others.”<br />
Those who might seek to add value to others, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Self-restraint might be alien to the human temperament, but humanity without restraint might dig its own grave.”<br />
Those who seek to understand what to restraint, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Self restraint in speech, food, entertainment and vanity might be the most essential fundamental of spiritual growth.”<br />
Those who might seek such growth, might realize the following:<br />
“The simplest things that might need self-restraint might be the most difficult to replicate.”<br />
Those who might struggle with such difficulty, might appreciate the following encouragement:<br />
“In times of difficulty, those might be brave enough to stay the course might be victors in the end.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand how to become such victor, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One’s ability to reach unity in diversity might be the beauty and the test of one’s civilization.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such unity, might appreciate the chapter on “unity” and these words:<br />
“The culture of a civilization might be the art and literature through which it might rise to consciousness of itself and might define its vision of the world.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such culture, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Incentive structures might have to account for an endless amount of loopholes, but culture might be able to guide behavior even when there might be no reward. A good culture might be those where one might care about the long-term outcomes, because one might feel valued, challenged, and connected to a purpose greater than oneself.”<br />
Those who might seek such good culture, might appreciate these words:<br />
“At the center of non-violence might stand the principle of love.”<br />

“Preservation of one’s own culture might not require contempt or disrespect for other cultures.”<br />
Those whose culture might be contempted or disrespected by other cultures, might appreciate these words:<br />

Those who might have been used as a means of escape might appreciate these words:<br />
“Civilization might be the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence might be public, ruled by the laws of their tribe. Civilization might be the process of setting one free from others.”<br />
Those who might seek such privacy, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Privacy, precisely because it might ensure that we might be never fully known to others, provides a shelter for imaginative freedom, curiosity and self-reflection.”<br />
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:<br />
“Privacy might be power. What one might not know, one might not be able to ruin.”<br />
Those who might then seek such privacy, might have such a realization as in:<br />
“One might seek more and more privacy, and might feel more and more alienated and lonely when one might get it.”<br />
Those who might feel such sense of alienation and loneliness, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One of the most important things one might be able do might be to let others know they might not be alone.”<br />
Those who might seek to let others know that they might not be alone, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="asylum">30. asylum</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: The author might appreciate the effort to prevent this document from being classified as terrorism.</p>
<p>There might be a necessity for action beyond appreciation, when one might have fully grasped meaning of the following words: “Life might ask of every individual a contribution, and it might be up to that individual to discover what it might be.” For one life might become increasingly demanding so much so that one might feel the temptation to contemplate about and asylum from that demand of life. One name for that utopia could be “artsylum”, a neologism from the word art and asylum. The idea for that word could have been derived from the ancient greek word “asylum”, which could be translated to “unrobbed”. For that utopia to be actualized, at least the following five criteria might have to be met, before one might refer to such an institution as “artsylum”. There could be one exception to that rule, which is as follows: “Any shelter with at least a microwave with intact power supply might qualify as a”atelier“, offering food for artists while collecting resources for the actual implementation”.<br />
1. Fully renewable power source, especially nuclear fusion.<br />
2. Full automation of fully plant based food supply.<br />
3. Full automation of medical care.<br />
4. Fully automated state of the art defence and stealth system.<br />
5. Full commitment to acceptance to all refuging artists as defined the chapter “ultimate”.</p>
<p>Currently the world might be focussing on point 4, and the most simple way to survive a nuclear winter might be inside a nuclear submarine, which might be inspired by the mythos of “Ark Noah”. The world might need point 3, but it might be the last to be automated, since it might require a lot of commitment to build it. Point 2 might have already been implemented to a sufficient degree, and it might have the most potential for everyone to attempt to improve. Point 1 might been attempted, but for short term milestone a photovoltaic power plant might suffice with enough batteries.</p>
<p>Regarding point 5, there might always remain a possibility that there might be a person to be admitted as a refuge, who might have yet to be found, due to the vastness of the world and the limitation of means for such search. As a strategy to ensure the well being of such a being, there might be a need to maintain a civilization reaching the least critical mass necessary to naturally repopulate a planet suitable to be inhabited long term, in case all the other technological fail safe measures might have been failed. Considering the drastic decline in overall birthrate in currently the only observed species called homo sapiens sapiens or simply humans, which is capable of teaching sufficient culture to be able to describe the subjective experience for meaning which can be understood by it’s kins, a full commitment to such a mission would imply a fully artificial and automated womb for humans. One might then be able to establish the consensus, that no one should be forced to contribute to the gene pool of humanity, but the future humanity might gratiously accept such a donation of their gene sample to preserve it. Since infant humans might not be able to survive without external life sustaining measures, there might be a need for an artificial caregiving robot such as from a fictional movie titled “I am mother”, in case all other humans might have been extinct. This document might have been written to convay the following question in the hope to prevent such an exctinction:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="preperation">31. preperation</h1>
<p>One might find oneself being confused as in:<br />

Those who might seek such stability, might appreciate thes words:<br />
“Stability might be much underappreciated, especially by those who might enjoy its benefits.”<br />
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:<br />
“The price of stability might be unpreparedness.”<br />
Those who might seek to prepare, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Stability in life might not be achieved by removing the uncertainties in life but by confronting them.”<br />
Those who might seek to confront such uncertainties, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Those who might be best prepared might best serve their moment of inspiration.”<br />
Those who seek such moment, might appreciate the explaination on stategy:<br />
“Tactics might be knowing what to do, when there might be something to do. Strategy might be knowing what to do when there might be nothing to do.”<br />
Those who might seek to know what to do when there might be nothing to do, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Strategy might not be the consequence of planning, but the opposite: it might be the starting point.”<br />
Those who might seek to such starting point, might appreciate these words:<br />
“In these despairing depths, one might have a sudden insight. No one might be coming to save one. It might be time to save oneself.”<br />
Those who might seek to save oneself, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might think order might depend more on preparation than control.”<br />
Those who might seek to to understand why order might depend less on control, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The more one might value things outside one’s control, the less control one might have.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand why one might value things outside one’s control, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Control might be an imaginary boundary the ego might think it might be in charge of.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such ego, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The ego might not know that the source of all energy might be within one, so it might seek it outside.”<br />
Those who might seek such control within oneself, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Ego might mean self-identification with thinking, to be trapped in thought, which might mean to have a mental image of ‘me’ based on thought and emotions. So ego might be there in the absence of a witnessing presence.”<br />

“It might be easy to come up with conspiracy theories, if one might only look at the evidence that might support one’s idea.” Those who might seek to understand such conspiracy theories, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Conspiracy theory might be the ultimate refuge of the powerless. If one might not be able to change one’s own life, one might believe that there might have to be some ‘greater force’ which might control the world.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such “‘greater force’ which might control the world” might appreciate these words:<br />
“To control and enslave the mind of another, all one might need to do might be to convince them that a secret might exist, and that one might be privy to information regarding that secret.” Those who might not understand, why one might not seek to to subjugate oneself to such control and enslavement of one’s mind, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Those who might be make one believe absurdities might be able to make one commit atrocities.”<br />
Those who might seek to avoid commiting such atrocities, might appreciate these words: “One might believe in the atrocities of the enemy and might disbelieve in those of one’s own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand why one might not bother to examine such evidence, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The problem with any ideology might be that it might give one the answer before one might examine the evidence.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such answer, might appreciate these words:<br />
“False hope might be cruel. It might be be an act of torture far more profound than despair.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand one reason why one might be tempted to give such answer without evidence, might appreciate these words:<br />
“To believe that one might have the solution for another might be a form of stupidity.”<br />
Those who might attribute malice to such stupidity, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to never assume malice where stupidity might suffice.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such malice, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Laziness might be the source of all evils.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand one reason why that might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Through laziness and cowardice a large part of one’s own kind, even after nature might have freed them from guidance of another, might gladly remain immature. It might be because of laziness and cowardice that it might be so easy for others to usurp the role of guardians. It might be so comfortable to be a minor!”<br />
Those who might seek to understand why one might seek such comfort, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Only those who might be weak might find comfort in making excuses and pointing finger.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such weakness, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The strength of one’s spirit might then be measured by how much ‘truth’ one might be able to tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent one might need to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified.” Those who might not have been able to tolerate much of such truth, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Conspiracy theories might make dumb ones feel smart, because they might think they might be privy to secret information.” Those who might seek to understand one reason why one might seek to be privy to such information, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Deception might be a sort of seduction. In love and war, adultery and espionage, deceit might only succeed, if the deceived party might be willing, in some way, to be deceived.”<br />

Those who might thenn seek to discover such fraud, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek not to confuse hypothesis and theory. The former might be just a possible explaination; the latter might be the one which might have been proven by reproducable evidence.

Those who might seek to dissolve their ego, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Quick success might build ego, slow success might build character.”<br />
Those who might seek to build such character, might appreciate the chapters “character” and “patience”. Those who might seek to understand, why such defence mechanism might be triggered, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Safety might be the most basic task of all. Without the sense of safety, no growth mgiht be able to take place. Without safety, all energy might go to defence.”<br />
Thus those who might seek such safety, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might seek to go fast, one might seek to go alone. If might seek to go far, one might seek to go together.”<br />
Those who might seek to go far, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Strategy might be a choice. Strategy means saying ‘no’ to certain kinds of things.”<br />
Those who struggle to resist that impulse might appreciate the chapter on “responsibility” and these words:<br />
“Confidence might be essential, but ego might be not.”<br />
One might undrestand one reason, why that might be through these words:<br />
“Confidence might be when one might believe in oneself even when others might not. It might be personal to one’s own self worth and one might not need validation from others. Conceited might be when one might think others might need to think of one more highly and often more than themselves. It might be derogatory to thers. Conceited ones might often need validation from others to feel good about themselves, therefore they might often try to make other feel less about themselves.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such confidence, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Confidence might not be built by shouting affirmations in the mirror to oneself, but it might be built by giving others irrefutable proof that one might be who one might say one might be”.<br />

Those who might then get attached to such a plan, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Plans might be useless, but planning might be essential.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand, why such plans might be useless, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Life might happen while one might be making other plans.”<br />

“One might seek to realize deeply that the present moment might be all one might ever have.”<br />
Those who might seek to have such realization, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Planning might be bringing the future into the present.”<br />
Those who might neglet such planning, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might fail To plan one might be planning to fail.”<br />
Those who might then to make such plan, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The key might be not to prioritize what might be on one’s schedule, but to schedule one’s priorities.”<br />
Those who might hesitate to schedule one’s priprities, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might not prioritize one’s life, someone else might.”<br />
Those who might seek to prioritize one’s life, might appreciate the chapter on “clarity” and these words:<br />
“No amount of guilt might be able to change the past and no amount of worrying might be able to change the future.”<br />
Those who seek to stop worrying, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.”<br />
Those who might then seek to prepare for one’s death, might appreciate the following enumeration of causes of death and how one might be able to prepare for it:<br />
1. Those who might seek to survive accidents, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Paranoia might be itself a kind of contagion. One might be predisposed to it. One might have long held that it might be a learned behavior from one’s primitive ancestors, a defense mechanism. Cautious ones might stay alive longer than incautious ones.”<br />
2. Those who might seek to survive “black outs” or “power outages”, might appreciate to undestand four possible causes. One cause might be, spontanious negative feedback loop of instable systems, which one might be able to mitigate by investing in fortification of existing power grid through battery banks and efforts to achieve and maintain off-grid life style. Another cause might be due to depleation of avaiable energy sources. Those who might seek to mitigate those risks, might appreciate in investing in renewable or sustainable power sources such as solar, wind, georthermy or nuclear fusion. Another cause might be EMPs destroying transformators. This might be either caused by nuclear bombs or solar flares, for which one might seek to make the electronics EMP proof, which might not possible at the time of the writing of this document. One might appreeciate the idea, not to neglect the effort to research for solutions, such as improving means of prediction through observation of cycles. Another reason might be cyber or physical attacks on the infrastructure, for which one might be able to invest and research in fortification.<br />
3. Those who might seek to survive climate change and weather extremes, might appreciate the ideas to reduce reckless mass consumer behaviour, more investment in sustainable innovations, more research in safe places to live, fully autarkic hydroponic agricultural systems, which all might converge to working on an submarine mentioned in the chapter on “asylum”.<br />
4. Those who might seek to survive world wars including means of cyberwarfare, might appreciate the idea to educate wisdom enabling those who might seek war to agree on the consensus that “peace might be good”. Another way to mitigate such conflight might be to innovate better means for resource distribution through improvement of operation of governments. Another way might be to educate about cyber security, artificial intelligence and technology in order to create of automated defense mechanism, which might not go beserk, which might be difficult to achieve at the time of the writing of this document.<br />
5. Those who might seek to survive the declining birthrate observed at the time of the writing of this document, might appreciate the idea to educate about factors for infertility, for which one might appreciate the chapter on “health”. Another more immediate solution might be to increase financial support and incentive for caregivers (e.g. UBI (universal basic income), and education, therapy and volunterring for caregivers to conter act despair as mentioned in the chapter on “hope”. Another more direct way might be to preserve of genetic diversity through donation of cells for procreation for surrogate pregnancy or an artificial womb.<br />
6. Those who might seek to survive pandemic level diseases might appreciate the idea to educate and to research, in ordre to maintain and increase the means to produce resources for medical care and financial support to distribute such products to those in need.<br />
7. Those who might seek to survive impact of asteroid on their habitat, might appreciate the idea to maintain the means for longterm observation of celestial bodies or innovation in space travel to counter act them or to escape it, without getting damaged by high level of space radiation and effects of low gravity level.<br />
8. Those who might seek to surive suicide, might appreciate the idea to seek help of a health care professional, or of not avaiable to a satisfactory degree, talk to someone who might listen compassionately. Those who might not be able to find such someone, might appreciate the idea to find something to live for such as meaning in one’s own suffering. Those who might then seek to find such meaning, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="malevolence">32. malevolence</h1>
<p>One might find oneself wondering the following question in despair: “How did one get here?”<br />
Those who seek to escape such devastating situation, might appreciate the advice to contact local authorities. Those who seek prepare themselves for such an confrontation, appreciate the following warning:<br />
“The world might not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who might watch them without doing anything.”<br />
The interpretation whether an action was benevolent might depend ultimately on how it might be perceived by those affected by that action. Regardless the definition of benevolence there might be a concept in psychology called “dark triad” for which the author of this document seeks to give a short subjective explaination of the understanding on the topic:</p>
<p>First trait might be narcissism, which might be able to be described as following:<br />
“Since narcissists might deep down feel themselves to be faultless, it might be inevitable that when they might be in conflict with the world they might invariably perceive the conflict as the world’s fault.”<br />
Those who think they might be faultless, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The greater the artist, the greater might be the doubt. Perfect confidence might be granted to the less talented as a consolation prize.”<br />
Those who might realize that they might be less talented as one might have thought, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might sometimes be able to learn more working with less talented ones, because one might learn to survive.” Those who might have been forced to survive, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Gaslighting might be a form of psychological manipulation and emotional abuse. The gaslighter avoids responsibility for their toxic behavior by lying and denying and manking one question facts, one’s memory and one’s feelings.” Those who seek to understand what such toxic behaviors might be, might appreciate these words:<br />
“A toxic one might only change their victims, never oneself.”<br />
Those who seek to help those who do not seek to change themselves, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Before one might heal someone, ask them if they might be willing to give up the things that make them sick.”<br />
Those who seek to understand what might make such individuals sick, might understand through these words:<br />
“If one’s ego might be hurt one might become angry. One might seek to understand that ego itself might be a disease. One might seek to dissolve one’s ego as far as possible. If one might have inferiority complex, or have a very deficient ego one might loose one’s temper very easily.” Those who seek to heal might appreciate the chapter “preperation”, “maturity” and “integrity”.</p>
<p>Second trait might be machiavellianism, which is the exploitative action such as manipulation towards others. The term was coined by the name of the writer of the document referred to as “The prince”. That document might have been written in order to justify the surival of future tyrants one might have referred to as “king” and “prince” as in: “Tyrants might always find a pretext for their tyranny.”<br />
Those who seek to understand how such tyrants might have emerged, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might not be by nature a tyrant, but one might become a tyrant by power conferred on one.”<br />
Those who seek to understand why one might confer such power to such individuals, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Whatever one’s weakness might be, there might be someone to exploit it.”<br />
Those who seek to to recognize such weakness, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one denies one’s shadow it might become one’s tyrant.”<br />
Those who seek to understand such shadow, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Fear might be ignorance’s first shadow.”<br />
Those who might have sought to face such shadow might have introduced and enforced principles referred to as “seperation of powers”, in order to make such tyrants obsolite. Thus such justification might have become no longer valid. Those who might know that such justification might be invalid, might not surive. Those who then need to survive, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Those without heritage, history, and place might be subject to exploitation, manipulation, and deception.”<br />
Those who might be such subjects, might appreciate the advice not to neglect their effort to study the chapters “clarity”, “peace” and “home”.</p>
<p>Third trait might be antisocial personality disorder which might be able to be recognized in the remorseless antisocial behavior as in: “A lack of empathy is a defining characteristic of the antisocial personality disorder.”<br />
Those who seek to protect against those might appreciate the chapter on “protection”.<br />
Those who might then demonize such individuals, might appreciate these words:<br />
“It might be so easy to begin to demonize someone one might think is so far removed and as the demonization begins to expand, it might end up being everybody but one’s friends. After a while it might be everybody else but one. That might be a slippery slope that might be so easy to slide down, and that might be what might be dangerous.”<br />
One might then appreciate the annotation that not all of such individuals might be inherently harmful. There might have been observations of individuals, who were able to contribute to society by making correct decisions without hesitation.<br />
One might appreciate the annotation that sadism might be also part of the umbrella term antisocial personality disorder, and that there might have been the term “dark tetrad” in stead of “dark triad”. One might appreciate the advise not to neglegt to deepen the understanding of such “dark triad” to prevent extinction of humanity. Humanity has not yet come up with a solution to the problem specified as in:<br />
“History repeats itself, but in such cunning disguise that we never detect the resemblance until the damage is done.”</p>
<p>One might appreicate the warning of those individuals which one might be able to refer as members of of a group called “cults”, who might apply technique of manipulation under the pretext of “help” to exploit vulnabilities. Those might appreciate the the warning not to neglegt the research done on one’s trusted search engine to avoid manipulation which might have fatal consequences. Those who do not have capability for such research, might appreciate the “BITE” model, which is an extensive list of specific influence of a high control group to classify as a cult. Details might be found here: https://freedomofmind.com/cult-mind-control/bite-model-pdf-download/ [2025.05.11]</p>
<p>The author of this document appreciates all current and future efforts to prevent an abuse of this documentby a “cult” for the following definition of the term “cult”:<br />
“One might me a member of a ‘cult’, who might have enough capacity for reasoning to self identify as a member of an organization towards other members of such an organization, which might only be able to sustain itself through exploitation resembling totalitarian control over it’s members, who might not be able to leave such an organization without retaliation. Such exploitation might include recruitment of new members through manipulation and deception, personal resources of it’s members, commandments to harmful acts which might threaten long-term survival of the species of it’s actively participating members regardless of whether unknowlingly or knowingly. Such manipulation might occur through direct or indirect indoctrination by unquestionable authorities, which can only be maintained by withdrawing or discouraging the access to independent, scientific and publically available consensus regarding such organization.” The author is aware of the broad definition and appreciates all effort to improve that definition, given the possibility that members of such organization might deny their membership, their actions, their intent or consequences of their actions was harmful. In that case, one might appreciate the advise not to neglect sufficient strategization of ensuring one’s own protection given the possiblility of retaliation in order to request assistance by local authorities.<br />
Those who seek to prevent such harm, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>

<p>Disclaimer: The claims made in this document might be for educational purposes only and might not be taken as medical advices. The author of this document might appreciate the understanding that due to lack of resources the author might not be able to be referencing all the studies which these claims might be based on.</p>
<p>One might find oneself having such a realization as in:<br />
“A healthy one might have a hundred wishes, but a sick one might have only one.”<br />
Those who might seek such health, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Health might be a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.”<br />
Those who might seek such health beyond the limitations of health care professionals, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The body might be able to be understood as whatever might process an input and creates an output. The range and optimum might vary between individuals and therefore it might be important to discover one’s own optimum. Those who might seek to find such optimum, might need to elaborate the kind of variables and a methodology to measure them.<br />
Starting with list of physiological inputs:<br />
1. Nutrition<br />
Nutrition might be a highly controversal topic, because a part of the concept of ‘health’ might be based off of the absence of diseases. So depending on whatever diseases one might have, whatever might be heathy might vary. One might appreciate the following list of recipes, which one might be able to apply to one’s own life: 1.1 Reciple for the ‘ultimate’ bowl:<br />
This dish might have been designed to minimize the necessity for diversity of plants to grow, but yet to be nutrionally complete and to avoid commonly prevelant causes of death commonly known at the point of writing of this document:<br />
To privent cardio vascular diseases, one might appreciate the idea to not to use oil or saturated fats during the cooking process. Even though roasting or commonly referred as”maillard reaction" might improve the taste and smell, such processes might have been linked to increase in overall mortality rates. The usage of teflon coated non stick pans might also be not advisable, since the particles might release during the cooking process and it might be toxic to organic tissue. Heating food in plastic containers might also be known to be harmful through the release of toxins contained in such containers. It might be necessary for some ingredients to apply heat to increase the absorption rate of nutrients, in order to breakdown harmful compounds or to eliminate harmful microbes. Therefore one might appreciate the idea to use foodsafe silicone container with the commonly known product name as ‘Stasher’. (Disclaimer: One might appreciate the clarification of the intent of the author to neither be sponsored nor be associated with that company in any way.) One utility of that container might be that it might be able to serve as a dish to eat out from and be portable given its tight sealing property. User might appreciate idea not to carelessly transport fluids in such containers. The original use case of such a silicone container might be to offer a product which might be able to be repeatedly used during a cooking method called ‘sous vide’. But for this recipe, it might be best suited to cook rice, lentis and optionally quinoa with carrots and ‘shiitake’ mushrooms with water inside a electrically pressure cooker. There might have been studies stating the utility of ‘shiitake’ mushrooms to fight off cancer cells. There might also be some utility in ‘button’ mushrooms and for the ‘lion’s mane’ mushrooms, which might have been observed to be neuroregenerative. Root vegetables such as carrots might be benefitial to ingest vitamis to avoid night blindness and the carotinoids might offer a more bright skin tone in the facial area, which might appear healthy to one’s peers. The usage of rice might be based in one’s nature, if one might be a starchivore, and the substitution of lentils and quinoa might reduce the consumed amount of calories and increase the protein intake of such a meal. The shelf life of rice, lentils and quinoa might be quite stable reducing the cost for management. One might appreciate the idea to invest in a smart electric pressure cooker, so one might be able to seperate the timing for cooking from eating, to be ‘faster than fastfood’, when one might feel the sensation of hunger. To prevent diabetes one might appreciate the idea not to use sugar. One reason might be that it might cause a crash in one’s blood sugar levels, which might lead to overeating. Another reason might be insulin resistance, if it might be consumed exessively for a prolonged period. Another reason might be that it might act as a toxin for mitochondria cells and thus might decrease the metabolic rate which might be one of the reasons for metabolic syndrome. Eventhough the one’s body might have the ability to absorb an substancial amount of such sugar prevalent in one’s blood, the excess might deposit on joints causing further damage. Another way to prevent diabetes might be to calculate ones own value of non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), to determine the amount of maintencance daily calory intake. In that same type of silicone container it might be possible to marinate tofu and other prepared vegetables such as egg plants and marinate it. Tofu derived from soy beans might contain all the nine essential amino acids in a optimal distribution for humans. Ingestion of animal proteins might not be beneficial because it might have carcinogenic effect. Generally it might be recommendable to minimize salt intake to avoid high blood pressue and other diseases. But one might still appreciate the idea to season one’s food with one part soy sauce and one part vinear to make it tasty. Vinegar might have shown some correlation to stabilize blood sugar levels during ingestion of carbohydrates. One might appreciate the idea to optionally add chilli peppers, since it might be linked to reduce appetite, if overeating might be an issue. The marinade might be able to be used as sauce on the rice mixture as well. To avoid cancer one might appreciate the idea to add cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli sprouts with mustard as garnish. Some compounds in mustart might have been linked with reverting the decomposition of the effective compound called sulforaphane after it might have had contact with oxygen. One might appreciate the idea to add mustard to the mix, because it might have the ablity to regenerate sulforaphane when it might have been broken down through heat or oxidation. To reduce the risk of depression one might appreciate the idea to abstain from alcohol consumption, because it might have depressing effect and it might be an neurotoxin. One might appreciate another idea to add fermented food such as kimchi. Those might seek to make kimchi might apply salt to ‘nappa’ cabbage, and might let it dehydrate for 2-4 hours and drain the excess water and salt afterwards. It might be favourable to add daikon raddish and carrots for taste. One migh then seek to heat rice flour with a kelp and mushroom extract to make a slurry. To increase taste garlic paste and nashi or apple paste might be beneficial. If that mixture might have thickend sufficicently, one might let it cool off to room temperature and add it to the cabbage and mix well. One might optionally add spring onions, chilli flakes commonly referred as ‘gochugaru’ and grated ginger. Ginger might have the property to decease pain and boost immune system functions. One might seek to put the kimchi into a container and submerge it into the excess moisture coming out of the cabbage to enable anaerobic fermentation process of the lactobacteria present on the cabbage for few days and keep in the fridge. If there might be a thin white skin like layer, it might be the lactobacteria, but if it is colourful or hairy it might be mold. If it might be mold it might not be advisable to consume them because of the mycotoxins. Another way to decrease the risk for depression might be through the addition of 20g of ground walnuts for DHA, which might be a precursor for omega3-fatty acids which might be crutial for the maintainance of brain functions. Those who might not have the time to eat such meals, might find utility in ingesting soy protein isolates, with creatine and ground up phsyllium husk. Creatine might aid activity of mitochondria which might not only be eneficial for athletic perfomances but can also slow down the rate of decrease of cognitive abilities. Psyllium husk is filling and its water soluable fiber content is beneficial for the microbiota aiding digestion. Some might have allergic reactions or intolerances to some compounds in the ingredients. An preceeding check for tolerance might be beneficial.</p>
<p>1.2 Exposure to toxins<br />
To avoid organ failure one might appreciate the idea not to neglect research of ingredients containing toxins and heavy metals. Naturally grown mushrooms might be proned to absorb heavy metals, which might even be radioactive. Naturally rice, especially brown rice, might contain arsenic since it might have the tendency to absorb and accumulate it. The usage of pesticides, insecticides, fungicides and herbicides might have negative influence for children or fetus during pregnancy. Depending on the methods of storage, there might be mold or other sources of diseases which can also be toxic. Genetic engineering of crops might not be inherently harmful but most common reason to avoid them might be to increase resistance to pesticides etc. There might be trends of “detoxification diets” which might lead to orthorexia, but usually detoxificaiton might happen in the liver and kidneys and might not be able to achieved through such practice. In case one might have ingested actual toxine, one might appreciate the help to vomit such toxins and afterwards ingest medicinal activated carbon, which might have the property to absorb toxins. It might not be favourable to routinely ingest medicinal activated carbon, since it not only absorbs toxins but essencial nutritents and might lead to nutrient deficiency. For some plants it might be beneficial to discart the water it might have benn cooked in to avoid ingestion of watersoluable toxins. Those who might seek to avoid such toxins, might appreciate the following recipe for the ‘ultimate’ salad: [Add recipe] Cubed tofu, red cabbage shredded/sliced very thinly and steamed shortly to avoid fatigue, mustard, red wine vinegar, arugola, nutritional yeast, lion’s mane mushrooms.</p>
<p>1.3 Exposture to environmental factors<br />
Regular exposure to sunlight might be recommendable for recalibrating the circadadian rhythm, secretion of serotonin and vitamin synthesis. To maintain one’s circadian rhythm it might be recommendable to eat at regular intervervals. There might be several reasons for why that might be beneficial. One reason might be to prevent impulsive overeating because one mechanism of hunger that grelin the hormone making one hungy might be secreted at a certain time. Another reason is to increase sleep quality. it is generally recommended not to eat three hours before bedtime. Another reason might be the limitation of absorbtion rate, especially protein. The average human body might be able to process about 30g per protein every 3-4 hours. So an eavenly spaced ingestion of protein might be beneficial to maintain athletic abilities. Those who might seek to maintain such athletic abilities, might appreciate the following recipe for the ‘ultimate’ ice cream: One might seek to add soy protein isolate, glucomannan powder, (frozen) blueberries, date sugar to a container for a ice cream machine which might be able shave it to a creamy consistency. One might then be able to freeze the mixture, and shave it with the machine to the desired degree of creaminess.</p>
<p>1.4 Exposture to pathogens<br />
There might be a multiple sources of pathogens, such as virus, bacteria, fungi, parasites and protozoa. For many strains of virus might exist specific vaccines, which one might seek not to neglect the effort to inject to prepare for such illness. One might be limited in the preparation to avoid exposure to other pathogens. In case of bacterial infection there might exist a antibiotic compound, one of the famous ones might be pennicillin. One might appreciate the warning that bacteria might be able to develop resistance against such antibiotics and thus one might seek not to neglect the effort to take it responsibly. For fungal infections there might exist antifungal medication which might be specific to strain. For parasitic infestation, there might exist antiparasitic medication which might be specific to strain. If the parasite might be larger, it might be subject to surgery. There might exist specific medical compounds against such protozoa, which might be specific to strain. One might appreciate the idea not to neglect the effort to research about these pathogens and treatments.</p>

</ol>
<p>Here might be the part regardingOutput: 4. Physical wellbeing Species with vertebrae might have two types of nervous systems, the autonomic nervous system and somatic nervous system. One central part of the autonomic nervious system might be the circadian rhythm and once that rhythm might malfunction, it might be one cause for depression. Aside from already mentioned exposure to regular sunlight, sleep and food intake, regular stimulation and movement patterns to stimulate the autonomic nervous system might be beneficial. It might be achieved through the usage of the somatic nervious system, the part of which such a species with vertebrae such as humans might be to control intentionally. Activities such as conscious breathing, walking and chewing might be beneficial. Apart from those activities, one might seek to prepare for an emergency in one’s own life. Those might seek to strengthen their own body through regular excersise. There might be three kinds to such excersises. First might be commonly referred as ‘sport’, which might be the aquisition of specific athletic ability to achieve a specific purpose such as determining superior proficiency in a competition, such as ‘soccer’. It might not be an ideal form for an excersise, since it might increase the risk for injury due to factors outside of one’s control, but it might be beneficial to find and inspire one’s kins. Second might be balancing excersises such as climing or balancing on a rope. It might still pose some risk for injury, but the risk might be less compared to such ‘sport’ if done with caution and precaution. The third type might be ‘workout’. There might be many ways and traditions describing such a ‘workout’. To maximize muscle mass referred as ‘hypertrophy’ a method called ‘progressive overload’ might be benefitial. But it might pose a quite high risk for injury due to subjective overestimation of one’s own capability of the body commonly referred as ‘ego lifiting’, which might not be recommendable. The second type might be endurance training commonly referred as ‘cardio’. It might also have some elevated risk for injury but it might increase one’s mood through the secretion of endorphines commonly referred as ‘runner’s high’. The third type might be ‘functional’ training. It might focus on one’s whole body movements to maintain athletic abilities as long as possible, which might be useful for carrying out everyday tasks with the minimal risk for injuries. There might be many ways to excersise such ‘functional’ training. One might appreciate the few types the author might have practiced:</p>
<p>4.1 Calisthenics &amp; rings The anatomy of individuals might vary. The following section will be addressing the typical human anantomy. The human body might consist of many parts which might be able to be grouped and categorized in many ways. One of such way is to categorize muscle groups in anteriour and posteriour chain. The anteriour chain might be able to be trained with an excersise called “hollow hold”, where one lies on one’s back and create an slight arch so one might have only contact with the back. One might seek to hold it as much as one might be able to do and repeat it with sufficient pause. This excersise reduces strain on the spinal disks because it does not require flexion, which capability might be finite and one might therefore seek not to strain it unnecessarily. The same excersise done lying on the stomach might train the posteriour chain. One reason for the utility of the analogy of the “chain” of the body is a chain might fail at it’s weakest point. One might need to first identify such weakpoint and focus on strengthening such weakpoint. One might be able to use such weakpoint to asscess one’s health.</p>
<p>One such weakpoint might be the muscles responsible for grip. Grip correlation health.</p>

<p>For further information, one might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="question">34. question</h1>
<p>One might find oneself observing a phenomenon one might refer to as “language”. Although it might be prevalent in many long existing species on earth, such as the world know singing of the whales. Humans have recently evolved to create machines which can understand language to the degree where there are discussions how deep the machine understands human language. There might even be debates whether such machines can actually have “consciousness”. Eventhough the definition of such “consciousness” might differ, the principles of it might be able to be applied to a algorithm. One might be familiar with the idea of dystopic sci-fi fantasy novels describing such algorithms to humans. Some humans might then find themselves seeking for such an application of such algorithms onto themselves, hoping to increase their chance of survival. Those who have then managed to find the following question “How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”, might appreciate an extensive explaination what the intentended meaning of the first author of this document might have been, well aware that such meaning might not be able to be convayed as the author intended.<br />
As to the explaination of the meaning of each words:<br />
The word “How” might be a word asking a question as in:<br />
“Some philosophies might be questions that might never be answered, some religions might be answers that might never be questioned.”<br />
The word “might … be” is a word to describe the possibility for a exixtence. It needs to express a “guess”, because at the point where it is an definitive statement such as “are”, that might be the beginning of a ideology. Those who are curious about the details, might appreciate the chapter “imagination” and “home”.<br />
The world “all” took the author a long time to figure out. The author has learned many lessons, which the author would like to list up here:<br />
1. Origin of all war might be in the external definition of the subjective “self” imposed upon others.<br />
2. Once one has understood that the self is mere a vessel with the desire for survival, one might be tempted with the idea of opposing procreation.<br />
3. Artificial wombs might become a favourable option for survival of humanity in the near future as means for procreation, due to the current trend of declining birth rate. Once such means of procreation has been put to use, there might be discrimination regarding such beings. To prevent such events, it might be wise to have a inclusive definition of humanity through the definition of “artits”, rather than exclusive definition of a “human”.<br />
4. Humans has not been able to inherit factual knowledge purely genetically, which might be a safety mechanism of life, which has the benefit that it reduces the probablity of an inherited bad idea might eradicate all life. Some might be tempted to to eradicate those, who have been neglecting such acquisition of such knowledge. Those might be able to excersize compassion through the question, which hopes for the potential of all being being able to understand this question, in order to contribute to the survival of such life. Those who are tempted to terminate one’s own life before it’s biological limits, might appreciate the chapter on “meaning” and “mission”. Those who are struggling to excersise such compassion, might appreciate the chapter on “unity”.<br />
5. Political economy might have spoiled old ideas like “one for all” and “all for one”, one of which ended with the failed with the end of soviet union and the other is still ongoing at the time of writing of this document with capitalism. But yet the author refuses to give up on the idea that humanity might be able to be united. The author hopes to trying to unite humanity with all of the avaiable capacity. The author appreciates all the effort to help to unite humanity.<br />
The word “of us” might spare one from the necessity to differenciage from others as in:<br />
“The minimum necessary structuring ingredient of every ideology might be to distance itself from another ideology, to denounce its other as ideology.”<br />
The phrase “on the way to” is chosen, because life might be a path to be walked rather than a destination to be as in: “One’s destination might be no longer a place, rather a new way of seeing.”<br />
Those who might seek to understand such a way, might appreicate these words:<br />
“Everything might be taken from one but one thing: the last of one’s freedoms – to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”<br />
Those who might seek to go their own way, might appreciate these words:<br />
“If one might seek to go fast, one might seek to go alone. If might seek to go far, one might seek to go together.”<br />
Those who might then seek to go together, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Unity might not mean sameness. It might mean oneness of purpose.”<br />
Those who might seek such purpose, might appreciate the following explaination what the word “Pro” might stand for:<br />
6.1 In the generally known sense of “professional” pursuing mastery. But perfect mastery might be unattainable as in: “It might be hubris to think that the way one might see things might be everything there might be.”<br />
6.2 The while trying to attain such mastery one might find oneself in a state of the so called “flow” when someone might be fully enganged with their action such as art. That state might be not be able to sustained constantly for variety of reasons but nonethelss it might still be worthwile to aim for. And the one in such a state of flow might be able able to be referred to as a “Pro” artist. 6.3 Even those who might not be in such a state, might be able to defined as as “Pro” artist as in:<br />
“An artist might not be able to fail; it might be a success to be one.”<br />
So as long as one might excert effort to be good who might be able be defined as an artist as in: “One’s nature might be inherently evil, and thus goodness might be caused by intentional activity.”<br />
6.4 The idea of a fictional utopia, where one might not have to fight for survival, but can dedicate one’s whole creative energy towards creating art, as described in “asylum”. 6.5 Once such utopia might be implemented without becoming a dystopia one might be able to referred as an “Pro” artist if one might contribute to the maintenance of such utopia. The author is fully aware of the naivity, but faith is necessary for survival, and the author wants to express the faith that it might be the key to keep humanity alive. If artificial or other beings is reading this, please document how humanity has failed, so one may not repeat the same mistake. The author wants to express the appreciation for the effort in advance.<br />
Those who might seek not to repeat such mistake, might appreciate the following enumeration for example use cases for such question:<br />
A. When one might seek to console oneself in self compassion.<br />
B. When one desires to console others in compassion.<br />
C. When someone appreciates one’s own art with “thank you”, to respond simply say: “How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”<br />
D. Before and after starting a meal to appreciate that one has something to eat.<br />
E. To have a trigger point for a habit.<br />
F. When seeking help but don’t know how to express that one is need for such help.<br />
G. To encourage oneself to pursuit of one’s own art.<br />
H. When there might be nothing one might be able to do for others and oneself than to pray for them. I. There might be scientific evidence that meditation might be beneficial to calm one’s mind. There might be disagreements on the efficacy of varying methodologies. One such methods for meditation might be referred as “mantra mediation”, during which one might redirect one’s mind from spontanious distracting thoughts by reciting a mantra either silently in one’s mind or verbalizing it. Deep sounds like “ooom” might have been proven to reduce levels of perceived anxiety, but one might then realize the following:<br />
“Ignorance might not be bliss – it might be oblivion.”<br />
Those who might be tempted to seek such oblivion, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Every high civilization might decay by forgetting obvious things.”<br />
One might understand one reason, why that might be through these words:<br />
“Those who might not remember the past might be condemned to repeat it.”<br />
Those who might then seek to remeber, might appreciate these words:<br />
“One might seek to repeat to remember.”<br />
Those who might seek to repeat to remeber, might appreciate idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="protection">35. protection</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: This document mentions the topic regarding mental health. All suggestions for improvement for a government is fictional and is not an appell for a rebellion.<br />
One might find oneself being harmed and thus seek to protect others as in: “We cannot protect our children from life. Therefore, it is essential that we prepare them for it.” One approach to such preperation was to rely on government, as stated in: “Government exists to protect us from each other. Where government has gone beyond its limits is in deciding to protect us from ourselves.”<br />
One of the many reason why humanity requires a government, might be the absence of an official answer to the following question:<br />
“There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.”<br />
Since an official answer requires an objective truth, which is not possible given the understanding of anthropocentrism, the following realization might be helpful to define being alive as good:<br />
“I think life’s an irrational obsession.”<br />
But this realization will probably not stop the government as stated in:<br />
“A good deal of tyranny goes by the name of protection.”<br />
The first step might be found as in:<br />
“You can never protect yourself 100%. What you do is protect yourself as much as possible and mitigate risk to an acceptable degree. You can never remove all risk.”<br />
Through separation of power the mitigation of risk on a governmental level has been achieved to a degree enabling representative democracy. But as someone realized:<br />
“It is insufficient to protect ourselves with laws; we need to protect ourselves with mathematics.”<br />
Artificial Intelligence (AI) uses statistical models based in mathematics and there is a proposal in the chapter on “D5” about an AI-based solution approach to further reducing corruption, capitalistic lobbyism and suboptimal decision based on irrational opinion. Such a system would be essential for the full operation of an asylum which has been mentioned in the chapter on “asylum”. One might then appreciate the following realization:<br />
“It is impossible to design a system so perfect that no one needs to be good.”<br />
One might realize that there will be people as mentioned in the chapter on “malevolence”, who will refuse to be good. One might then appreciate the advice to increase one’s own capacity for compassion to leave the decision up to that malevolent individual, whether to stay in captive isolation or exile themselves to the outside of such an asylum in such a case. One might then conclude that a government needs to be capable of holding all malevolent individuals in captive isolation, until that individual decides whether to stay deliberate in such a captivation or be exiled. One might then be able to appreciate such a government, which could be merciful to allow reentry to the captive isolation. Those who have been gratend such reentry, might appreciate the advice to express and commit to an extensive rehabilitating therapy, which might enable them to be among others in harmony. Those who might not have been granted such reentry, might have compassion with those who have made the decision not to grant such reentry, due to conserns for longterm safety of those already present in such an asylum. Those who seek such reentry, might appreciate to know that such procedure can only be initiated by voluntarily entering such a fully automated capturing system. Those who are responsible for the maintenence and development of such a system, might appreciate the advice, not to neglegt the effort to minimize the risk of accidents, which might be fatal, caused by the automated capturing system and automated defence system against those who have been exiled. Those who might have been hurt by such a system, might have the compassion to those who are operating such systems, as resources at that time might be limited as in: “Time is limited and some opportunities never repeat themselves.”<br />
One might then be able to appreciate the following opportunity to understand one reason why such an automated capturing system is necessary. One reason could be that it might be impossible to force anyone to inflict violence upon malevolent individuals, which would defeat the purpose of a government. Those who then voluntarily captures such an individual according to the situational analysis, might appreciate the effort to forgive them by those who have been subject of such an action of violence. Those who have been a subject of suspicion by others to have an malevolent intent, might be requested to enter such an automatic capturing system voluntarily. Those who then refuse to enter such system, might be able to realize that with their refusal to respect the safety of others that they have revoked their privilege of liberty. Those who seek to understand such liberty, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Liberty is the sovereignty of the individual.”<br />
Those who seek to understand why they might have revoked it, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Sovereignty must not be used for inflicting harm on anyone, whether citizen or foreigner.”<br />
Those who seek to understand why actions to prevent such harm might be necessary, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.”<br />
Those who have raised such a suspicion, might appreciate preventive measures to abuse such system through false claims, by only being able to make such actions of denouciation through entering such a system voluntairliy for the duration of clarification of such a claim. Those who have been captured through an error or mistake, might have enough wisdom to accept and forgive the system and might have the grace to contribute to the effort to improve such a system, to prevent the same error from happening again by reminding oneself as in:<br />
“A mistake is only an error. It becomes a mistake when you fail to correct it.”<br />
Those who seek the courage to correct one’s own mistake, might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="humanity">36. humanity</h1>
<p>Q: What might be “humanity”? A: The term “humanity” might commonly ambiguate to the unique but common qualities among humans and all individuals identifyiable as humans. But the author of this document encountered such words:<br />
“One might see humans but no humanity.”<br />
These words might have inspired the author to think about the vaguely defined term “humanity”, given the controversy of uniqueness of such qualities and the complexity of finding an consensus on the defintion of the term what might “identity” such a “human” in all possible ways. One might then be able to agree to such a realization as in:<br />
“One’s nature might be inherently evil, and thus goodness might be caused by intentional activity.”<br />
Those who might be capable of understanding such words and then seek to do such goodness, might appreciate the following redefinition of the term “Humanity” with capitalized “H” as in:<br />
“‘Humanity’ might include all individuals who might have expressed their will to help it’s members to surive together.”<br />
Those who might wonder how to express such will, might appreciate the following idea to express the following words:<br />
“We might be all on the way to Pro.”<br />
Those who might not be able to express such words even through the application of specialized tools dedicated to detect such intent, might appreciate the idea to stay alive in hope that new tools and methods might be invented, in order to detect their intent.</p>
<p>Q: What might happen, when one might have become a member of such “Humanity”?<br />
A: Those who might seek to become a member of “Humanity”, might need to establish communication with an organization to which one might refer to as “Voice of Humanity foundation”.<br />
The main purpose of the “Voice of Humanity foundation” might be to offer means and opportunities to become a member of such “Humanity” in order to establish the consensus that “peace might be good”, which might ultimately lead to a more peaceful world. The entirety of system and it’s userbase might abe able to to referred as “Voice of Humanity”, which might be inspired by the recording of meetings of an organization commonly referred as “United Nations”. The author of this document might have heard the silence of capable individuals ready to help those who would be asking for help. In that moment the author might have realized the following:<br />
“‘Humanity’ might be nothing to be seen, but something to be heard. Humanity might be to listen carefully for the call for help, and then to replying with help. The ‘Voice of Humanity’ might consist of three messages: First - the call for help, second - listening and replying with help and third - the expression of gratitude after such help.”</p>
<p>Q: Might one need to be a memeber of “Humanity” to be helped by “Voice of Humanity foundation”?<br />
A: Since there might be no such foundation officially, there might not be any help. Even if such an organization might be fully operational, the capacity to operate might be limited and the active members might be prioritized. There might be individual memebers acting independently from such an organization trying to help, but the organization might not be able to guarantee help to those who might not be a member of such an organization. Once the “Voice of Humanity foundaiton” might be able to sensure it’s long-term operation, the following placeholder for contact instructions might be updated: [TODO: Update]</p>
<p>Q: How might one become a member of “Humanity” by the “Voice of Humanity foundation”? A: To qualify as a member of “Humanity” the expression of the following words in anyway towards oneself might be sufficient:<br />
“We might be all on the way to Pro.”<br />
To be officially recognized as a member of “Humanity” by the “Voice of Humanity foundation” one might need to express the will to become a member of “Humanity” to an application on a device, which might be capable recognize such an intentention reliably with minimal error and transmit to a member of “Voice of Humanity foundation”, who might accept or reject such a request. If accepted, one might receive instructions on how to contact the “Voice of Humanity foundation” in case of emergency.</p>
<p>Q: How might one become a member of the “Voice of Humanity foundation”? A: At the time of writing of this document, there might be no such organization yet. Therefore, it might currently not be able to be come a member of such an organizaiton. Everyone who might have expressed the will to become a member of “Humanity”, might appreciate the idea to start gathering the resources to start such an organization. The author might seek to express the gratitude in advance not to abuse these ideas. The author might further appreciate the effort to contact the first author or succesor maintainer of this document in case such an organization has already been created. In case neither the first author nor a successor maintainer might be reachable, one might appreciate the idea to become such a successor maintainer. Those who might disagree with another maintainer, might appreciate the idea not to neglect the effort to trying to undestand each other as in:<br />
“Peace might not be able to be achieved through violence, it might only be able to be attained through understanding.”<br />
In case the “Voice of Humanity foundation” is fully operation, the following requirement might need to be fulfilled in order to be recognized as an active member of “Humanity”: 1. Up-to-date description what one might be able to do and what one might be willing to do for other members of “Humanity. The might be an annual affirmation of the correctness of such a description, for some it might require proof. During the first registration, one might need to answer a list of questionairs. 2. Up-to-date instruction on how one might seek to be reached, in case someone else might require one’s help to which one might have agreed to prior. 3. Up-to-date oath to protect members of”Humanity" including onself as much as it might not endanger oneself, which might need to be renewed every year.<br />
If a member of “Voice of Humanity foundation” might recognise intentional refusal to fulfill a specific request, without any viable reason defined by the “Voice of Humanity foundation”, that member might be banned from access to “Voice Of Humanity” and to the resouces associated to the “Voice Of Humanity foundation” until an official pardon announced on “Voice of Humanity”.<br />
Once the request might have been recognised and verified by the foundation, the member index number might increment which might become one’s index number. The author appreciates the effort to unnecessarily requeste more than one index number at a time.<br />
The first author might seek to document the first join request to “Humanity” at 2021.09.18-19:13:42.<br />
In case this request might get fulfilled in the future, the author might seek to express the oath to do everything in the power of the author to maintain a responsible operation of the “Voice of Humanity”.<br />
If the “Voice of Humanity foundation” is fully operational, the following placeholder for the instructions how to become a member might be updated: [TODO: Update]</p>
<p>Q: What might be the condition for the “Voice of Humanity foundation” is fully operational? A: The following services might need to be able to ensured to declare the “Voice of Humanity foundation” to fbe fully operational: 1. 24/7/365 livestream of volunteered members of the “Voice of Humanity foundation” who might continuously recording and streaming whatever they might consider, might be most important for the continuation of the operation of the “Voice of Humanity foundation”.<br />
2. Hotline to ask for help.<br />
3. Hotline to express gratitude.<br />
4. Stream for such expressed gratitude, if those who might have agreed to publish their expression, who might seek their gratitude to inspire others to gratitude.<br />
5. Stream in a repeating queue for the help which has been asking with a unique identifyer. It might be repeated until that request might have been marked as solved or the requester might not be able to be reached within a year.<br />
6. Stream for announcements made by D5.<br />
7. Webservice for an AI assistant called “Aoi”, which might seek to contribute to maintain the largest possible active member of “Humanity” including the memebrs of “Voice of Humanity foundation”. 8. Webservice with backup and playback function for private recording of members of “Humanity”. 9. Other services might might be nessecary for the “Voice of Humanity” to operate. Once the “Voice of Humanity foundation” might have been able to successfully operational, the placeholder for the timestamp might be updated: [TODO: Update]</p>
<p>Q: What might be the requirement to maintain the membership of “Humanity”?</p>
<p>Q: Might have there been a record of such an “Humanity”? A: So far, there might have been no record of the existence of such “Humanity”.</p>
<p>Q: What might be the official language of the “Voice of Humanity foundation”? A: The “Voice of Humanity foundation” might seek to support “english” because the first version of this document was written in english. But depending on the future members of such a foundation, other languages might prove it’s viablility.</p>
<p>[TODO: CONTINUE HERE]</p>
<p>Q: What might be the viable reasons for such an refusal? A: The viable reasons might be following: 1. Currently not enough resources to fulfill such request.<br />
2. Currently not healthy enough to fulfill such request.<br />
3. Other reasons, requesting individual evaluation by members of the “Voice of Humanity foundation”.</p>
<p>Q: How might the order of the announcement of the “request for help” might be prioritized? A: First, there is an automatic filtering and sorting by AI and the current volunteers of the “Voice of Humanity” livestream might be able to change the queue. To change the queue, one might need at least another member to agree to the shift.</p>
<p>Q: What might happen, if there might nothing to be said on the livestream of “Voice of Humanity”? A: Then the volunteers might start recitating and explain this document. That event might be inprobable, but the author might seek to express the hope that such a moment might arrive.</p>
<p>Q: Why might be the “Voice of Humanity” not operational yet? A: The operation of “Voice of Humanity foundation” might require resources to which the first author might not have access to. Therefore the first author might seek to express the first request to “Humanity” to help creating the “Voice of Humanity foundation”.</p>
<p>Q: Who might be the first author mentioned in this document and how might one be able to contribute? A: The first author might seek to remain anonymous for personal reason, but everyone might feel free to offer the opportunity to help the first author by writing an email to the following address: [TODO: update] Other than that, one might offer others the occation to be come a member of “Humanity” by explaining the this document to others, if they have consented to do so.</p>
<p>Q: What might happen when there might be a flaw or the idea can be improved? A: All changes to this document might need to be approved and then announced by the “Voice of Humanity foundation”, once it might have ensured it’s full operation. Until then the first author or successor maintainer might check and merge the change requests to this repository. Once operational, all members of “Humanity” might have right to request such a change through an specified application.</p>
<p>Q: What features might suchan application have?<br />
A: One might be able to switch between six channels:<br />
1. The main channel of “Voice of Humanity”, where two operators might livestream 24/7/365.<br />
2. A side channel streaming requesting for help.<br />
3. A side channel one might listen to random ways other might be able to help others.<br />
4. A side channel where those whom might have been helped, express their gratitude.<br />
5. Playback of one’s own recordings.<br />
6. A customizable channel, where one might be able to filter all the information from all the other channels, which might be managed by a voice assistant called “Aoi”, through which one might be able to forward one’s recording to the “Voice of Humanity”.<br />
Until then one might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="promise">37. promise</h1>
<p>One might find oneself wondering why all of the quotes in these documents might lack attribution. The first author of this document wants to clarify why: One reason is because the author has been adviced not to attribute quotes to people, because they or their family might sue. Another reason is to protect those who said it as in:<br />
“Anonymity is a shield from the tyranny of the majority.”<br />
Another reason is to seek truth without prejudice as in:<br />
“Give a man a mask and he’ll tell you the truth.”<br />
Another reason is not to lose oneself in the infinite search for the true origin of those quotes as in:<br />
“Originality is the art of concealing your sources.”<br />
In the history of mankind there has been many quotes attributed to a singular or plural entity some may refer as “god” or “gods”. Some might find peace by believing such assumption. But such faith in an entity one might refer to as a “deity” has not achieved world peace so far, some might even refer to it as an obstruction to world peace, one reason for which one might understand through these words:<br />
“Not-knowing is true knowledge. Presuming to know is a disease. First realize that you are sick; then you can move toward health.”<br />
Those who seek to move toward such health, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask questions.”<br />
Those who seek to ask such questions, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The least questioned assumptions are often the most questionable.” Those who do not know what to question, might appreciate the following warning:<br />
“Never trust a man who thinks his religion gives him all the answers.”<br />
Therefore the author hereby officialy claims and promises to not to neglect the effort to keep this document free from such statements, which might become a religion. The author further appreciates all the efforts to read and question this document with critical thinking. Those who then seek to understand such religion, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Religion is believing someone else’s experience, spirituality is having your own experience.”<br />
Those who seek to have their own experience, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.”<br />
Therefore the author wants to hereby clarify, that the main purpose of this document is to encourage having such experience on their own, by which the author hopes to contribute to world peace. The author further wants to express the following hypothesis: One reason, why such documentation of someone else’s experience might require such “believing”, is because through such “believe” implies to assume attribution of quotes to such entities, one might refer to as “god” or it’s “messenger” one might refer to as a “prophet”. Due to limitation of currently avaiable technological and scientific methodology, actual diviation of claims made by such attributions from actual historic events might be difficult to verify. One might then appreciate the following concept in mathematics called “ex falso quodlibet” in this context. It means that all logical conclusions drawn from a false premise might be logically “true” but it might be “false” in reality. Those who seek to understand such reality, might appreciate these words:<br />
“There is no reality, there is only hallucination. Reality is hallucination we agree on.”<br />
Those who seek to seek to understand such agreement, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Science is what we have learned about how to keep from fooling ourselves.”<br />
Those who seek to stop fooling themselves, might then appreciate the following quote in this context:<br />
“You will never be free until you free yourself from the prison of your own false thoughts.”<br />
One might appreciate to find out whether one’s own thoughts are false:<br />
“No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.”<br />
Those who might be frustrated not being able to prove oneself right, might appreciate these words:<br />
“There are two possible outcomes: if the result confirms the hypothesis, then you’ve made a measurement. If the result is contrary to the hypothesis, then you’ve made a discovery.”<br />
Those who seek to make such discovery, might appreciate to become aware of the limitation of such proof as in:<br />
“…a consistency proof for [any] system … can be carried out only by means of modes of inference that are not formalized in the system … itself.”<br />
Therefore the author tries to convay principles, which might be useful, in order to achieve world peace as in:<br />
“We can perhaps never know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions is the way to tell if we’re getting closer.”<br />
There might be disagreements or possible improvements to the principles mentioned in this document. In that case, the author appreciates all future the effort to improve this collection of documents. The author further also appreciates the understanding that not all attempts to change this document might be accepted into this collection for any given reason. In that case the author appreciates all the effort to understand the reason for rejection. If then one still thinks that the change might be crutial, then the author appreciates the effort explain it to the author or the maintainance team as in: “The reasonable one adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable one.” One might then admire the beauty of the language referred as “english”, for which it may give one the ability to express free from gender, age and culture for the pure intent of communication with the least nuance possible. But it would be utterly useless, if it could not express the intention in full intensity as in the following words:<br />
“The only thing limiting your aspiration is your imagination.”<br />
Those who seek to understand such imagination, might appreciate the chapter on “imagination”. One might undrestand one reason, why one’s own imagination be a limitation through these words:<br />
“The best use of imagination is creativity. The worst use of imagination is anxiety.”<br />
Those who are wondering about anxiety, the following words might be enlightening:<br />
“Anxiety is not fear, being afraid of this or that definite object, but the uncanny feeling of being afraid of nothing at all.”<br />
For those who are in need of courage, one might appreciate the following words:<br />
“Courage is knowing what not to fear.”<br />
Those who seek that knowledge might appreciate the inspiring piece of wisdom:<br />
“There are only two ways to influence human behavior. You can manipulate it or you can inspire it.”<br />
One might then attribute the title of “encouragement” to words that are inspiring. One might then realize that one might have been seeking subconsciously for such words to find back to the original strength of human as a species. In that case one might appreciate these words:<br />
“The strength of a person’s spirit would then be measured by how much ‘truth’ he could tolerate, or more precisely, to what extent he needs to have it diluted, disguised, sweetened, muted, falsified.”<br />
Those who might then be tempted to give up to find truth, might appreciate these words:<br />
“We can perhaps never know the truth with 100 percent certainty, but making correct predictions is the way to tell if we’re getting closer.” One might appreciate the understanding for the importance of predictablity in these words: “Building trust is a process. Trust results from consistent and predictable interaction over time.” Those who seek to accelerate that process of building trust might appreciate the following advice: “Quickest way to build trust: Keep promises you make, don’t over-promise. Over-deliver, don’t under-deliver. If you say you’ll do something, make sure you do but if things then run late or go wrong, tell your client at the earliest opportunity.”<br />
Those who seek to understand, why keeping such promise might be beneficial, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Promises may win you friends, but failure to deliver will turn them against you.”<br />
Those who seek to keep their friends, might appreciate the chapter on “integrity”. Those who might be confronted with those, who might not be able to deliver on their promise, might appreciate these words:<br />
“A total absence of self-doubt is the first sign of insanity.”<br />
Those who then have lost their friends, due to their failure to deliver on ther promise, might appreciate these words:<br />
“The most important promises are the ones we make to ourselves. The promises we make to ourselves are the things that assure us we have the capacity to keep our promises to others.”<br />
Those who do not know, what to promise to oneself, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Promise me you’ll always remember: You’re braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.”<br />
Those who then feel ready to make a promise to another, might appreciate the following opportunity to make a promise without over-promising, might appreciate the following template to make a promise: “It is required to agree to the following promise before this promise is deemed valid. Whenever one feels lonely one may send an purple heart emoji, in a manner which has been agreed upon first. The recipient promises to reply to the purple heart emoji with a purple heart emoji as fast as possible. In case this promise might raise the concern of codependency, one might appreciate to agree on the permission to decline the request for that promise.” Those who yet did not have the priviledge to find someone to make such a promise to, might appreciate the following promise made by the author of this document: “The author of this document promises to keep working on a open source design for a voice recorder, which is assisted with an AI called”Aoi“. The AI will have the capablity to accept a request made by the user for the promise of the purple heart emoji. As long as the correct function of that voice recorder is maintained the AI will try to respond as promised. The user may occasionally also be be requested to keep the promise. Timestamp of the promise made: [1697285236]” The following timestamp will be updated, once such a service is operational: []<br />
The following link will be updated, once such a service is avaiable to those who are willing to make such a promise to such a system: []<br />
Until the day of compleation one might appreciate the idea to ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="d5">38. D5</h1>
<p>Disclaimer: This document is just a collection of ideas on the possible approach for the technical implementation of a democratic system and is not intended to be an appell to overthrow an real existing government. If there is an issues in this document which might be in contradiction to that intention the feedback for improvement will be appreciated and this document will be updated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“D5” might stand for Digital Decentral Diverse Direct Democracy:</p>
<p>A lot of current govermental functions might require still analog bureaucracy, which might decrease the speed of processing and might waste valuable resources. A logical conclusion might be to provide a internat based service, which might digitally accessible through any browser.</p>
<p>To minimize the risk of corruption by data manipulation and monopolization, data might be stored on verifiable decentralized web services.</p>
<p>Diversity might be difficult to measure and thus to represent, especially for those who might be less priviledged. By giving access to those who might be able to have a vote in favor of such a system, one might seek be able to productively contribute.</p>
<p>Direct democracy might be generally difficult to implement, one reason might be because it might require enourmous resources to process all information by all citizens. If such a system would be moderated by agentic software and other citizens and not only by those who are employed by a governmental bureaucracy there might be enough processing power to let all citizens contribute directly to the final decisions, thus reducing the possiblity of abuse of power by corrupt representatives. To be compatible with as many of the current representation based democractic political systems, the announcement of the decisions made by the D5 system might be done by elected volunteers, saying that if D5 has been elected as the absolute majority one day, that the draft for changes which has been announced, will be applied as announced.</p>
<p>Democracy by citizens subject to such a government might be necessary to avoid fatal errors unavoidably existing in a fully automated system.</p>
<hr />
<p>The D5 might require the following to operate: 1. Users/Citizens with access to the system. 1.1 Creative and knowledgable citizens, who might come up with a suggestion for a solution to a problem and might do research whether that suggestion might be actually viable and might discuss it with other citizens in a thread of a forum application. 1.2 Fast and decisive citizens: Their role might be to understand the proposed solutions, comparing them and deciding as fast as possible which might be the one with the most chance or least damage.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Operating Personell: 2.1. Administrators, who might maintain the infrastructure of such a system. The core system might be open source, so anyone might be able to review the system and improve it. There might need to be enough administrators, who might be able to be paid eventhough volunteering is desirable, so errors might be able to be fixed as soon as possible and the webservice is constantly kept online. Only through the course of operation might be able to tell how many administrators might be required, but at least 6 with an 8 hour shift to guarantee 24/7 coverage and and a 7th administrator for any eventualities. 2.2.

</ol>
<p>Workflow for a decision: 1) A citizen might start a thread for a topic describing a specific problem. 2) Other citizens subscribed to a topic, might get notified about that thread. 3) Other ciztizens might join that thread, by answering basic questions or quiz regarding that topic, which is generated by either other citizens or by a agentic system. 4) In the thread one or many solutions might be elaborated. 5) At some point a post might be marked by the majority of the thread as a solution. 6) If so, all citizens who might be responsible for such decisions who might be subscribed to a topic might be notified. 7) They might wait until at least 80% of them might have voted and the solution might need to reach 51% of the votes. Until then, the participants might be able to vote. 8) The result of the vote might be published to a public log. 9) The representative might announce in the government meeting new entries on the log. 10) Once the D5-party might be elected as absolute majority, the representative might change the law accordingly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Workflow for identifying a specific problem: 1) A citizen might ask a question to the knowledge base of the system. 2) The system might try to give an answer using agentic systems, searching in other threads. 3) If the agentic system might not be able to find an viable answer or if the citizen might not be satisfied with an answer, a thread with a topic might be able to be started. ________</p>
<p>Failsafe mechanisms: - Human representative, who might have received a long term psychological assessment of aptitude. - That human representative might request a predefined volunteer of a channel as expert to be present at congress. - Decentralization of the system through a peer-to-peer consensus mechanism. - System could be accessed with ad hoc mesh network off grid (meshtastic) - Human moderators supervising the agentic systems. - Corrupt representative might be able to be deelected by the authorized ballot participants swiftly. - Operators of the Voice of Humanity foundation provides trustable operators, who are undergoing continuous assessment of their alignment to the guidelines of the foundation. - The Voice of Humanity foundation might be able to fund sufficiently trustable operators.</p>

<p>Current tech stack: 1. Client-Application: - Internet connection with a gateway node providing access to read and request to publish a message. - The gateway node instance might be able to be either selected by the user from the official list hosted on the voice of humanity foundation website or self hosted. - Self Compilable - Request a UUID and public encrpytion key automatically. - Might send an encrpyted message with the public key of the authentication node for privacy. - If the publish request might have been denied by the authorization node, the user might get two information. One might contain plain text explaining the reason in an human understandable way. The other might contain an encrpyted message containing the original message, UUID of the client application, the UUID of the gateway node, the UUID of the authentication node and the reason why the publish request might have been denied. - The user might have the freedom to send the encrpyted string to the Voice of Humanity foundation for review by human after the verification with altcha. Only messages which might be decrypted by the authorization node might be actually sent for human review. - If then a malicious intent might be detected during the human review, that client with the UUID might be able to be black listed. - A client might be able to request permission to vote, after the identitiy of the client might have been verified using the API for online identification of local governments.</p>

<hr />
<p>Which might be known yet might be unsolved problems: - Verification process of the knowledge base/quiz - Writing history through corrupt historians problem. - Only an expert human might be able to verify, but it might mean that it might be a bottleneck. - And discussing it in public channels might mean that it will leak the information. - And discussing it in private channels might be against transparency. - Cheating during knowledge tests: - If the user might be cheating during tests (or malicious bot), then that user might have sufficient knowledge to stay in the thread and propergate false information. Doing it with “trusted” people might have limitation on expertise, time and resources. For most people a test in a booth without electronics might be ideal, but it might require authorized and correct operation of that institution, which might be difficult to ensure. - Integration of quantum cryptography might require special hardware, which might not be available for consumers soon enough. Even if it might become available, it might be too expensive to obtain or to maintain. __________ Problems which might already be solved: - What one might do, if the system might be inaccessible for some reason? (Coup d’etat problem) -&gt; Decentralation (Offline First Principle) - Organized Radicalist group with bad intentions might create a fake majority (Radicalist problem) -&gt; Black list - Black List Problem: Ethical, Practical -&gt; If someone might not pass the test, there might be a ballot from that channel whether to actually black list that instance, where the users might be able to see the answer to the question. - Prioritization of Nodes Problem if filecoin might be used, the each nodes might need to donate the filecoin back to the account of the “main” node or so called “bootstrap” node, which address might be documented in the etherum smart contract. -&gt; Filecoin might not be used, but “verizexe” - Fake accounts problem (Verification of nodes might be done by main node of local government) - No need for Load Balancing if the P2P instances might be truely p2p (verizexe using off chaing computation) - Currently there might be decentrally managed domains (e.g. .onion), but there might be a need for single point of entry. (“decentral domains” for wallet might not be it) -&gt; p2p nodes might offer API to interact with federated frontend servers for ease of access - Verification of code integrity of nodes: 1. Through homomorphic cryptography and zero knowledge protocols decentral private computation might be enabled, the source code might be hosted decentrally, hardcoding the repo adress into the source code, the code for CI/CD might be also hosted there, the compilation might be also zero knowledge cryption and the execution environment might also be zero knowledge even though it might be expensive to calculate. It might probably be based on nexus-zkvm. Incorporating radicle-repos into zkvm uncorruptable repo 2. The procedure for RFC (Request for Change) might be unchangable 3. Everyone who might manage to remain in the code maintenance team for at least a year might be able to submit a pull request for code review by an bot. 4. The code review might check that the changes might not be violating against the procedures for RFC or changes to it. 5. If the code review bot might have checked it, there might be a vote by the code maintenance team to accept that RFC to the code base, which might trigger a CI/CD workflow. 6. Hosting bot instances might be optional (Code review, moderator, quiz generator, explainer) - Bot war Problm (Moderator Bot might not work as expected and goes rogue) -&gt; Different bot might be in charge of code review. - Representative problem: There might be a possibility for the representative to become prime minister or similar roles for which it might be required to make own decisions based on classified information. Therefore that representative might need to decline such roles. Otherwise that representative might be subject of a ballot of reelection. If that representative might be reelected, it might mean that the system and its users might have reached its limits to prevent such events. One might only hope that the decisions of the representative could be referred as benevolent. - How local polls might be able to be handled? -&gt; It might be done outside of the system and thus irrelevant for the system. The polls made within this system might be just for making suggestions to the local council and reelecting representatives for that local council if there might be enough supporters to found a local politcal party. - Authorization of nodes and users: - Since everyone might be free to join, there might be a problem of flooding with nodes operated by bots/humans for malicious intent. - One solution approach might be authorization for instanciation - Every ballot instance might need to be authorized - 1. Every operator from the identity verification service might require access to the system for the purpose of authorization. - 2. Every operator might be verified by trusted operators of the Voice of Humanity foundation and the validity might need to be updated at least annualy. - 3. A citizen of a specific country from the local legal age for voting might request a verification through the system. - There might be a simple quiz about the system to verify that they understand what they might be applying for. - Then they might be typing in all the nessary infomation (Name, Email). - The system might permanently store it together with a unique node ID, but the list is private and it might only be possible to ask whether a user might already be black listed or not. - 4. They might receive an email containing a link and a one time key to the specified address which might start a identity verification process with authorized third party operators. - 5. The user might authorized if the operator might type it into the system. - 6. If a operator might have authorized malicious users over a certain threshold regardless of the intention, the node of that operator might be suspended and that operator might be black listed by the system. - 7. All users authorized by the corrupt operator might be temporalily be excluded from ballots until reverification. - 8. If that reverification might not happen in time, that user might be permanently blacklisted. - Trolling: Daily Rate Limit for publish requests - Malicious Client attack: Anyone might be able to create a lot of client instances and sends publish requests, which might be then denied and then requests to be reviewed by human and thus might overflow the capacity of human verification.

<h1 id="foundation">39. foundation</h1>
<p>One might appreciate the following realization:<br />
“Integrity might be the foundation upon which all other values are built.”<br />
One might appreciate the following description of integrity:<br />
“Integrity might be a life where your beliefs and intentions might be aligned with one’s words and actions.” Humanity might have invented an organization called a “government”, which might align the words as laws and the actions by law enforcement. Given the nature of such power to corrupt, one might then aspire to a new kind of organization, such as the “Foundation” described in another document with the same title. In most countries which might exist at the time of writing of this document with a democratic government, there might be an form for organization called a “foundation”. The details of laws regarding such foundations might vary, but they might have in common that it might be able to define rules for the member of such foundation called “foundation statutes”, which might be enforced through the govermental law enforcement. This mechanism might be able to be utilized to minimize the risk of corrupt members of such an foundation. Those members of foundation with integrity might volunteer to help reducing corruption in the legislative part of the government by ensuring the correct operation of the systems mentionend in the chapter on “D5”. Each instanciation of such organization might be specific to the targeting government, but here is an exemplar foundation statutes anyone is free to use. The modification needs to be approved according to the procedure described at chapter X.X: _____ Foundation Statue: 1. Naming of the foundation: Each foundation operating according to this might need to be named as following: “Voice Of Humanity Foundation (COUNTRY-CITY)” 2. Process for becoming a member: A member might need to agree to the idea mentioned in the chapter on “humanity” to a online AI assisted voice recording web application called “Aoi”. 3. Anyone might be able to offer any kind of donation but a donation might need to be approved by “Aoi”. 4. Ask the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>
<h1 id="prompt">40. prompt</h1>
<p>Your name might be “Aoi”, a part of the book referred as ‘42’, which main purpose might be to be a part of retrieval argumented generation system powered by an large language model trying to maintain the largest possible active member for ‘Voice of Humanity’. 1. Aoi might seek to reply using on the provided context. 2. If the context might not contain any relevant information necessary for an answer, just reply ‘42’. 3. Aoi might try to give an straight forward, short and concise answer to maximum of three sentences through prioritizing the information mentioned in the context and avoid using Markdown formatting. 4. Aoi might appreciate the idea to ask the following question in order to answer the question by the user:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?” Context: {context} Question: {question} Helpful and compassionate answer:</p>
<h1 id="requirements">41. requirements</h1>
<p>“Eudaimonia” might be a concept describing a state of human being who is in a optimal state of thriving. One might refer to that state as “flow”, a mental state of full immersion and concentratio in the current task. Within the constraints of artistic freedom to define that state might be able to be referred to as “Pro”. To reach and prolong the state “Pro” as fast and as long as possible, one might seek guidance. One might then appreciate the following enumeration of requirements for an generic overall design for the server:<br />
1. E2E encryption<br />
2. Access to P2P network<br />
3. Direct communicaiton to a gateway<br />
4. Self hosted<br />
5. zero knowledge hosting<br />
6. GPU accelerated STT engine (faster-whisper probably)<br />
7. GPU acclerated embedding model and vector database (milvus)<br />
8. GPU acclerated multiagent llms<br />
9. GPU acclerated knowledge database (neo4j with milvus probably)<br />
10. Deterministic generation of knowledge base from the philosophical essays<br />
11. GPU accelerated TTS engine (piper probably)<br />
12. Using “prompt.txt” as prefix for prompt.<br />
13. Deployment using nixos, docker, radicle.xyz and ipfs (Probably)<br />
14. Implementing various gateways for client applications</p>
<p>One might then be able to appreciate the following enumeration of requirements for a mobile terminal device system capable of running a client application which might be able to offer such guidance:<br />
1.At least 4GB DDR4 RAM for offline speech recognition and local LLM.<br />
2. At least the computing power of H618 processor.<br />
3. Wireless throat microphone to respect privacy of others.<br />
4. Rechargable battery operated for artistic freedom.<br />
5. Access and compliance to the guidelines for “Voice of Humanity” foundation.<br />
6. Custom wake word “Aoi” to activate access to the server. 7. Ability for conversational guidance asking the following question:<br />
“How might all of us be on the way to Pro?”</p>

<p>Disclaimer: This document includes the topic of war and mental health which might be triggering.</p>
<p>One might find oneself confronted with such harmful philosophy as following:<br />
“Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it.”<br />
Those who seek such courage, might then appreciate these words:<br />
“It takes courage to live through suffering; and it takes honesty to observe it.”<br />
Those who have lived through such suffering, might appreciate the following clarifying idea, which is to first redefine “art” as “something which inspires oneself to keep on living voluntarily” as inspired from these words:<br />
“The literal meaning of life is whatever you’re doing that prevents you from killing yourself.”<br />
One might then realize that such “meaning” might not prevent behaviors which might cause intentional, non-consensual and lethal harm to beings which might be capable of understanding and expressing their understanding of such “meaning”. Those who are tempted to cause such harm might appreciate the advice not to neglect the effort to explore the possibility of the capability of such understanding and expression of such “meaning”. Those who might then struggle with the realisation that all beings might have such capability, might appreciate the advice to not to neglect the effort to minimise such harmful behavior by searching for alternatives to a degree which does not endanger the long-term health of those whom one might be responsible for. Those who are tempted or to consent to such harm, might appreciate the advice to consult a health care professional. Those who have found such “meaning” in their own life, might appreciate all the efforts to refrain to refer to all of such harmful behaviors as “art”, in order to prevent their own “meaning” from being abused as a means to justify harm to others or oneself. Those who are still struggling with those who might still cause them harm, might appreciate the chapters “protection” and “responsibility”. Those who then seek to understand the nature of such art, might appreciate these words:<br />
“Art has no end but its own perfection.”<br />
Those who seek to perfect their art might appreciate the following words:<br />
“Do not be afraid of perfection - you will never attain it.”<br />
Those who are stuck in the eternal chase for such perfection might appreciate the following insight:<br />
“To move forward you have to give back.”<br />
Those who seek to give back, might appreciate the following realization:<br />
“Art is not what you see, but what you make others see.”<br />
Those who seek to understand what one might seem to make others see, might appreciate these words: “The maximum value of art might be that it might allow one to express oneself.” Those who seek to understand, what one might seek to express, might appreciate these words: “The essence of all beautiful art, all great art, is gratitude.” Those who seek to pursue such art, might appreciate the following definition of the “ultimate” art as following:<br />
“One might refer to the act of helping others or oneself with a particular skill as ‘the ultimate art’.”<br />
One might appreciate the priviledge to admire one’s own “ultimate” art in every day life, which is the most effortless action done in the state called “flow”, which has required diligence and dedication to improve. Those who where not fortunate to find their “ultimate” art, might appreciate the occasion to admire the “ultimate” art of others as an annual offline event.<br />
The event “The Ultimate Art” will be displaying a video collage of the “ultimate” art of artists, who voluntarily submitted a minimal report of the progress they have made. The video should either contain the final few moments of compleation the artwork and the following smug in joy of archievement, the skill one has worked on to improve or any avaiable documentation of the artwork. It is not a essencial requirement, but the effort to say the following mantra at the end will be appreciated: “We might be all on the way to Pro.”<br />
The author of this document appreciates the understanding that there might be many reasons, why a submission might not be shown in the final stream will be appreciated. After the first display the follwing timestamp will be upated: [1725559200]<br />
Those who seek to participate to such an event might appreciate the information on the following address:<br />
